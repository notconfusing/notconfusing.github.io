I was there too, and still am 2 years later. While I’m not a doctor, and ask you not to take this as medical advice, I hope you might gain something from my experience. My &lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/5-lessons-learned-from-3-months-of-healing-a-herniated-disc/"&gt;first five lessons&lt;/a&gt; that I wrote when I was just 3 months in remain cogent and apt, are a story without an ending. As the injury transitions into a memory rather than an urgent priority, I should leave this map for who ever finds it useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Recovery has an unintuitive shape.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="pain graph" class="size-full wp-image-4212" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2019/01/pain-graph-cropped.png"&gt; Herniated Disc Recovery: Pain Ranges over Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a graph of the changes in pain over time I’ve felt after nearly 2 years of healing my herniated disc. On the x-axis are the months since I carelessly jumped off a tall platform, and on the y-axis is a standard 1-10 subjective pain measurement. The surprising facts about this graph that I couldn't have guessed before hand are that it 1) is a series of ranges of over time, 2) does not include 0-pain during the first year, 3) is non-linear and non-monotonic, 4) constitutes 2 full years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first aspect I’d bring attention to is that isn’t not a line, it’s a sequence of ranges. While it’s true that at any single point in time there’s a single pain level, the pain varied hour-to-hour, day-by-day, so for any week the “average” pain I felt was less important the extreme values. During the first 6 months I was constantly feeling a lot of pain, I wondered if I was ever going to get better? Adding to this doubt was the fact that sometimes my maximum pain was more than my previous weeks, having slipped putting on underwear or another mundane act gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, after a while I did notice I would have moments of low pain, maybe a 4 or 3 on the scale. This insight was the key to finally understanding that I would &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; start not-feeling pain again. As I saw that those moments were increasing, then I could see that I was improving, albeit it at a glacial pace, and even if I had days of relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only now can I sketch in the final details of the limits on the time-axis. I both scoffed at and denied in my first months that this injury could take 2 years to heal, as my Physician-father-in-law kindly advised me. That’s at least 4 times as long as any other injury I’ve had in my life. I don’t scoff at the duration today like I did before, rather I’m glad that it’s a finite duration at all. I'm sure that's little consolation to anyone with a recent herniation, owing to what I call the "pain trap".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. The chronic pain trap.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, this a long and painful injury. I was in nearly constant pain for at least 6 months, a scenario that satisfies many definitions I can see online for “chronic pain.” Today, even though to a much lesser degree, I still experience flare-ups. It took me a lot of time though to understand nature of pain, and how it constitutes a mental trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I best understood what pain was doing to my psyche when I heard pain described as an “interrupter.” That is, it’s a biological process trying to get your attention. And in this case it was trying to get my attention all the time. That made it difficult to focus on anything else. This is where the trap is sprung because healing takes planning and a scientific mindset that requires exactly the kind of rational attention that pain interrupts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance after 6 months I began to notice that I hadn’t even really researched how to best heal my condition beyond a single visit to the doctor—and I am a professional researcher. I realized I hadn’t conducted real experiments with equipment, exercise or diet. Being in pain, I would simply lay on the floor and try to distract myself TV. While it was immediately relieving, I don’t think it was the maximum “healing” it could have been if I approached it with a clear mind. Once my focus returned in drips and drabs I was able to really try to troubleshoot the herniation. In parts 3 and 4 I share every technique tip and hack that I attempted, but there is one more than others that deserves special attention—laying down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Radical laying down.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research shows that laying down is the position that puts the least pressure on the inter-spinal discs [&lt;a href="http://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/1999/04150/New-In-Vivo-Measurements-of-Pressures-in-the.5.aspx"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. So I did that as much as possible—and more than what is perhaps "normal" in polite society. In general the question of my life became, "can I do it laying down?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alt Text" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/laying-down.png" width="640"&gt; Working laying down, on the cheap with a folding laptop stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest gain in laying-down time was in work. Luckily I have a job that involves using a computer most of the time, and \$20 laptop stand made the switch possible. The harder part of working laying down was explaining to colleagues why I was doing it for the hundredth time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't stop there, what about eating? At home I ate on my laying on my stomache, with a yoga bolster under my chest to gain some elevation. At restaurants, if booths were available that was a good opportunity to channel an idealized version of an Egyptian Pharaoh and dine at a half-elbow-prop . In cars and Lyfts, if possible I would ask for the front passenger seat and recline, all the way if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being horizontal, the next best is completely vertical, and I would stand on my morning tram commute even if seats were open. Once I spent all 4 non-take-off hours of a flight standing in the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss, if I didn't credit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rmeseguer1?lang=en" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1546723625064_1424"&gt;Raquel Meseguer&lt;/a&gt; and her opinions on vertical culture for emboldening me. Further, excellent listening on the hegemony of sitting &lt;a href="https://www.modernmann.co.uk/new/cloudspotting"&gt;in this Modern Mann podcast episode.&lt;/a&gt; I'm lucky to have just been a tourist in radical laying down, Raquel who is there more permanently is a strong and inspiring layer. For me laying down a lot was half the battle, and experimenting with all the other tips was the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Experiment with all the relief hacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can't hurt to try everything. It hurts more not too! It served me to be creative and holistic in my thinking. In order to illustrate that point best, let's inspect a list of everything I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sleeping&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep, how on earth could you get a good nights sleep when you can't turn the pain off? The answer is might be "in a way you are totally unaccustomed to." My habitual side sleep was not the least painful, it turned out. A few youtube physiotherapists recommended sleeping on the back with a lumbar support, a.k.a a towel rolled up. It took me several difficult nights to train myself to fall asleep on my back, and more again to find the right lumbar support height, but it did pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise was a difficult healing technique to get right. On the one hand I found it to be useful because it regulated my mood and kept me positive. On the other hand it sometimes didn't appear to aid healing or would regress my condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I felt up to it, the gentle exercises that I found I was able to do were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long walks of about 3-5km would help me warm-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found that walking uphill was most relieving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swimming.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strokes that don't involve backbending too much; the crawl was more painful than backstroke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t forget to lay in the sauna after, maybe for a very long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a trained yoga instructor, and so am adept at modifying positions for injury. That being said, most yoga, even with modification was too painful for me in the first 3-6 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would stretch but I was only ever doing extremely gentle fragments of yoga. I found that Child's pose and forward-fold in Gomukansa-legs targeted my back in the right way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 2 years I can still trigger sciatic pain through cow-pose, it's a slow road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, most things more demanding than gentle stretching hurt early on. Everyone of the following activities made me feel worse and I believe I exacerbated the pain typically for approximately the first 9 months to a year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pilates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Medicine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the promise of better living through chemistry? I was prescribed 2 pharmaceuticals during my only doctor's visit. They were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyclobenzaprine&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A muscle-relaxant. This really helped me during very acute pain mostly because I would tend to just zone- and pass-out, and waking up the next day. It's not a long-term solution for anything, but I was glad to have an escape route in emergency moments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meloxicam&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was taking Naproxen an over-the-counter to lower some pain. I felt that the stomache damage of NSAIDs were a high price to pay for the relatively small relief I got. Meloxicam gave me roughly the same limited pain relief but allegedly with less stomache problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Naproxen, here are the other over-the-counter and holistic remedies I tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Glucosamine condritin&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I took this to try and improve bone-health, it's effect wasn't perceptible to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turmeric&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is supposedly a natural anti-inflammtory, and replaced some NSAIDs on some days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnesium&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found the "calming" formulas containing magnesium to be helpful in relaxing out of the pain trap at times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oxtail&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm mostly a vegetarian, but once at a Jamaican restaurant my wife ordered Oxtail. Looking at and eating this spinal column, in a very unscientific way, made me feel more connected to the injury. A tad spiritual perhaps, but I now like eating the intervertebral discs of other animals. Also found in Phở.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alcohol&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I did not enjoy drinking in with a herniated disc, any temporary relief was not worth the compounded-interest pain of the hangover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannabis&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cannabis became legal in California during my injury. At times it felt very "cornered" to be high and still be in pain, and have less wit to take care of myself. At other times it would be a sort of natural-version of Cyclobenzaprine for me—allowing me to melt and drift off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Valerian root&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to cannabis, in but lighter and more reliable. Valerian root tea was at times a to partial escape the mental strain of the pain trap, without psycoactivity, but still drowsiness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Equipment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inversion table&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought a cheap inversion table off of Craigslist after seeing it recommended on Remi Sovran's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RemiSovranFitness"&gt;herniated disc tips youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;. I did manage to find a small amount of temporary relief upside-downing myself. I believe in gentler inclines for longer intervals than Remi's recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also made a poor-person's version using pillows and couch as a ramp, which had some efficacy for no money before I got the inversion table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TENS unit.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A friend of mine suggested that I stimulate my back with a TENS unit as I was inverted to alleviate the area. I tried it once and found unpleasant and ineffective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a Bath&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hot bath along with epsom salts before bed went a long way for me. I'm not sure it was healing, but it was relaxing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cushions&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found a sciatica pillow called the "relaxaback" which is a obtuse foam wedge that titled my hips forward. It worked quite well and even when I would forget to bring it somewhere I would sit on a folded up jacket to achieve the same effect. Don't be afraid to look silly for the sake of comfort—I didn't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Later when sitting was tolerable for more than 30 minutes, I found the "Backjoy" seat augmentation and slouched less felt less pain subsequently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a week into the injury staring in disbelief at a 2 year recovery period. Today I'm grateful that I didn't elect for a surgery, walked (layed) the long road and learned these humbling 10 lessons along the way. In this article I've tried to avoid giving advice and kept the focus on my own story. If you're still reading, it's because I imagine you are on the floor despairing as I once was. So I'd like to offer my story as a data point, and as a point of optimism. My injury was an arduous journey, but it had meaning, and a was a platform for self-discovery toward the end. I'd be glad to lend you a sympathetic ear on twitter &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/notconfusing"&gt;\@notconfusing&lt;/a&gt; if you can't yet see that end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herniated discs are not confusing,&lt;/p&gt;

On point 1 Momentum, I am entirely behind. On Distance (2) and Death (3) they are themes perhaps darker than I would like to delve today, but give lots to think about in the upcoming decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used to think 30 years old then the end comes&lt;br&gt;
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;Blackalicious, World of Vibrations&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;2. Distance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm pushing past 30. If I bow out as the years close in. Abandon my sound man and band and them. I'll give no blushing curtsey. To the proud shouts of close kin. I ground it into ground and then some friends . Just drop a dusty curtain on the loud crowd when the show end. And end the whole thing where no men found me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;WHY?, Distance, Mumps. Etc&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;3. Death&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now a n**** 30, so I don't think they heard me&lt;br&gt;
That the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed&lt;br&gt;
Tears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest&lt;br&gt;
The thoughts of no success got a n**** chasing death&lt;br&gt;
Doing all these drugs, hope for OD’ing next, Triple X&lt;/p&gt;

How do you feel about this as-personal-as-you-want-it-to-be, non-threatening, question? Those are the hallmarks of a good ice-breaker, and these are the best ones I've created or pilfered in the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Describe your ideal burger, layer by layer.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the SOAK festival in 2016 I suffered back spasms from an extended Butoh session, and in order not to spoil that last night I made a game of laying still in one public location from dusk to dawn. As I needed to entice people to keep me company among the night's many attractive options, this little ditty came to me. What works well about this question is its luxurious layer structure. It can't be answered monosyllabic. Thinking about the constituent parts creates an unwinding, an unraveling that the answerer doesn't necessarily need to know completely before starting. In this way the speaker can dollop out pieces of their personality slowly, which each layer a revealing different inner self. It's an act of additive creation—much like a burger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. What kind of Philosopher-\&amp;lt;blank&gt; are you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the SOAK festival in 2017 I suffered a herniated disk jumping off a tall novelty-wrestling platform. Again I needed to lie down for the majority of the night, and had ample opportunity to review my anxiety of recently dropping out of  my PhD program. I wasn't going to be a Doctor of Philoshophy, but, feeling limitless I wondered, could I be another kind? The term 'philosopher-king' came to mind, but it wasn't right either. 'Philosopher-athlete?' 'Philosopher-artist?' 'Philosopher-barista?' The beauty of this question is that you assert your conversation partner is a fully-fledged and self-labelling philosopher.  This means people have to dispell a pretension that you've foisted on them. It's a bit unfair, but if you're a bit familiar with your audience you can enjoy play of squirming together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.  Is there a particular storm you remember?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I didn't injure my back at SOAK 2018, I was on the lookout for new ice-breakers. I always knew it was possible to do it this way, and so and was relieved to discover one without bodily harm. I met a like-minded enthusiast of ice-breakers in my new boss, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/@natematias"&gt;\@natematias&lt;/a&gt;, and I knew I could trust him after he asked this question to open up our very first meeting. He'd just shared a photo of a storm he was in the day before, sailing in Boston. Was there a particular storm I remembered, he asked? This question gains it's power from the storm's power. The vividness of the memories that this question can invoke makes for potent material, impossible to fumble as a storyteller.  That's what you'll get out this question, a surefire story of fear,  wonder, or intrepid adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use these icebreakers, or feel like answering them, report back to me at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/@notconfusing"&gt;\@notconfusing&lt;/a&gt;. Happy breaking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>5 lessons learned from 3 months of healing a herniated disc.</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/5-lessons-learned-from-3-months-of-healing-a-herniated-disc.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-11-10T17:22:00-08:00</published><updated>2017-11-10T17:22:00-08:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2017-11-10:/5-lessons-learned-from-3-months-of-healing-a-herniated-disc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I suffered a herniated disc by foolish jumping off a large drop while camping.

As it  invaded almost every aspect of my life, my mood, my career, my friendships, it gave me lots of pause to reflect. This is what learned and wrote after 3 months. However in the end it took me 2 years to be pain free, at which point I wrote a follow up “&lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/?p=4206"&gt;5 more lessons learned&lt;/a&gt;” which also contains more practical lessons than the more abstracted ones here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The thing you can't do is sitting.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/1999/04150/New-In-Vivo-Measurements-of-Pressures-in-the.5.aspx"&gt;&lt;img alt="http://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Abstract/1999/04150/New-In-Vivo-Measurements-of-Pressures-in-the.5.aspx" class="wp-image-4165 size-full" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2017/10/nachemson_wilke.jpeg" style="width:422px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Postures and their disc pressures. My experience is closer to the Nachemson measurement than the Wilke, as I find that standing is a lot less pressurizing than sitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll probably find that laying on your back or stomach are the least painful positions, less than standing, and much less than sitting—and research agrees (see graphic 1). However sitting is really import in a society whose greatest challenge is a sedentary lifestyle. For instance, you can't work in a default desk-centric setting. While the price point for a standing desk is relatively low, it'll be a while until you heal enough to be able to stand all day. On the other hand, to comfortably work laying down all day is a different type of investment that won't blend into office life easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition travelling becomes complicated. Car trips, even when you aren't driving can be painful. Bicycling might start to be tolerable, but only after some time. A train, tram or bus offer some relief with their options to travel while standing. However the mere thought of sitting in an airplane for several hours is torturous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Healing will be non-linear.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do heal, but sometimes you get worse too.  The centrality of the back in the body means that few movements are free from danger.  Once I leaned too much when putting on my underwear, felt a snap-slip, and set myself back a week's progress. A month later I went to a job interview which involved 5 hours of sitting, which regressed me another 2 weeks.  And when you do finally feel relief, there exists another trap. It's easy to mistake temporary moments of no pain, for being better. Classic mistakes are going back to sport or the office chair too early and re-triggering the injury. Even a hopeful return to side-sleeping are can surprise you with painful middle of the night wake-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Because its so long, it becomes very mental.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing time estimates for herniated discs range from 6 months to 2 years. Therefore you'll probably develop some sort of depression from your limited subset of activities. My typical way to combat  depression, you would imagine, is being with your friends. Yet a herniated disc can affect this too, as a lot of standard hangouts, such as getting dinner, turn out to be exercises in pain endurance. Watching TV is another easy way to pass the time on the floor, but can intensify the isolation after months on end. I found that I had to take as much pleasure as I could from walks around my house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Physical therapy recovery theories conflict.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_Flexion_Exercises#McKenzie_extension_exercises"&gt;McKenzie or Williams&lt;/a&gt;? Should you backbend to "squeeze in" the herniation? Or forward bend to "vacuum in" the disc liquid? Theories about how the mechanics of disc healing are an unresolved academic debate that leave no confidence in the sufferer. I had to stop "&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/sHXnna6WEOI?t=28m35s"&gt;training my back to tolerate some flexion&lt;/a&gt;" and also stop trying to backend my way to impingement-free lifestyle. Finding the right therapeutic exercise is unfortunately a process of self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Exercising won't necessarily help.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it were about rehabing in the gym it would be easy. Rather, it seems at the beginning that a better option would be to attempt full immobility. Sadly without any exercise, depression is likely to increase.  This goes for sleep too, whose only pain-free position of on-the-back-with-a-lumbar-towel-roll might take time to adjust to and make for lost sleep. Walking is likely to be the first and only active exercise that is tolerable once you manage to make it out of muscle-spasms. Be prepared to re-appreciate the lost art of long walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through not being able to live my life as I wanted too I became much more acquainted with the disability-rights activist attitude that everyone is disabled, only some people haven't discovered their disability yet. Healing a herniated disc is not easy or intuitive, it's a matter of reconfiguring your lifestyle, and it will stop you from taking the privilege of spinal health for granted.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Trivia Pub Quiz #1—Awesome Festival 2017</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/trivia-pub-quiz-1-awesome-festival-2017.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-19T19:45:00-07:00</published><updated>2017-09-19T19:45:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2017-09-19:/trivia-pub-quiz-1-awesome-festival-2017.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Prompted to find alternative ways to entertain my friends due to a herniated disc, I tried my hand at writing a trivia/pub quiz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grants for research and tools (such as WHGI) - which minimally contribute to the targets of people or articles - have been extremely valuable in improving our understanding of the gender gap and how or why it manifests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the uses I've seen online, the most reported statistic seems to be the progression of the female ratio of biographies in English Wikipedia: increasing to 16.78% by end of 2016 from approximately 15% in the two years we've been measuring. Seeing this interest, in the future I would plan to build better longitudinal visualizations. So we might see exactly how this statistic (and all others) have changed week-on-week throughout WHGI's history.  Additionally, using anomaly detection to automatically call out large spikes and drops in Wikidata, would be a good service to the community. I hope in 2017 I'll have some time to roll-out more advanced analytics in store for measuring Wikipedia's systemic biases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>For Harry and Carie on their Wedding Day</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/for-harry-and-carie-on-their-wedding-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-08T18:10:00-07:00</published><updated>2016-10-08T18:10:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2016-10-08:/for-harry-and-carie-on-their-wedding-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[[[Marriage is part of humanity.

It is the intention of parents in such families to make it plain to their children that they all play cultural and not societal roles, that they are only roles, and that they are all truly concrete persons behind them.

But this week I was proved wrong when another Wikipedian messaged me with a query unlike any I'd received before (empahsis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi Max, I've pinged you a couple of times, but in case you're not getting them, would you mind commenting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's about an edit your bot made to Wikidata that changed the infobox of a featured article about a book about the Holocaust, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_%28book%29" title="Night (book)"&gt;Night&lt;/a&gt;. The bot fetched data from the Italian Wikipedia, rather than from the English (the book is in English) or the French (it was first published in France).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that the Italian Wikipedia calls it fiction (a novel), rather than memoir. This is an issue because Holocaust deniers call it fiction too, so we've avoided doing the same. It's not that only Holcaust deniers call it that (it is memoir, but parts appear to have been fictionalized, so "novel" is not a horrible genre for it), but there is sensitivity around it because of them, and the author doesn't like it to be called a novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm trying to find out why your bot would have fetched the data from the Italian Wikipedia. Any light you can shed on it would be appreciated. Best wishes, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SlimVirgin" title="User:SlimVirgin"&gt;SarahSV&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SlimVirgin" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"&gt;(talk)&lt;/a&gt;]{.small} 02:12, 29 April 2016 (UTC)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is that this was an honest mistake because my intention, in line with the philosophical underpinnings of Wikidata is to avoid this sort of cross-cultural conflict. Wikidata has a pluralist ideology, that is it can support many competing facts without favouring any one. It allows you to say that the book Night is: a novel (according to these historians), and separately an autobiography (according to some other source). My intention was to use this pluralist structure, with the sources being Italian and English Wikipedias, but a bug in my code prevented that ideal.  (By the way I believe the Holocaust did happen, &lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/kleins-search-for-klajnbohms-an-ancestral-research-trip-to-zwolen-poland/"&gt;read about my ancestral trip to Poland to find out more&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the technical issue was that I missed an 'else' case because of a poor programming design. In some cases just the first Wikipedia languages I was inspecting would be represented in Wikidata. I was utilizing English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Polish, Swedish Wikipedias, in no particular order, and in this case Italian went first, and only it's opinion about the genre of Night, was carried into Wikidata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now feel and understand empirically why testing so is crucial. It's no longer and abstract, academic curiosity backed up thinly by seemingly unrelated horror stories. Thank you life for teaching me this lesson. And perhaps, as my colleagues have commented, the way algorithms - and all their shortcomings - shape history, is a rich venue for research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interested programmers may read on for details of the bug. &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/notconfusing/0dfed7e9bea694ecb476c1cc7b4b2d88#file-viafbot-infobox-book-L418"&gt;Looking at my old code&lt;/a&gt;, I find a comment describing the states I was looking for between the localClaims (scraped from various Wikipedias) and the remoteClaims (already existing in Wikidata). I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;there are three states:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;noMatchingClaim, so we add our claim&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;matchingClaimUnsourced, so we add our source&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;matchingClaimSourced, claim was already present and had the same source, do nothing&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I proceed to try and find these states by writing what is a basically a big decision tree. So big that it's a text-wrap nightmare, 8 blocks deep.&lt;br&gt;
[]{.small}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;noMatchingClaim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;matchingClaimUnsourced&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;matchingClaimSourced&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteClaimList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteClaims&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itervalues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteClaim&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteClaimList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;localClaim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteClaim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteSourceList&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteSourceDict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;itervalues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteSource&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteSourceList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                            &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;localSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;remoteSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;localSource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
                                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;matchingClaimSourced&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matchingClaimSourced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Very unfortunately I missed about what to do if we have a &lt;em&gt;matching claim with a conflicting value&lt;/em&gt;, it should be have been recorded as noMatchingClaim, but I overlooked it because of the heavily nested structure. To fix this I think flat, and functional would have been better. And of course, some testing wouldn't have gone amiss either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This is similar to the divided political "spectrum", that is, not a spectrum at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a test case take the IPA, the least versatile "acquired" taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the consumer has developed a false consciousness and accepts  the objectionable and anti-rational quality of IPA ethanol, that consumer has joined the in-group.&lt;img alt="" class="alignright" src="https://i.imgflip.com/jdpx5.jpg" style="width:490px !important"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are alienated from the fruits of your tastebuds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drinking at breweries is an activity built around spending money to learn distinctions between products. That is a commercialism of experience and product.&lt;/li&gt;

I'd wanted to retain my friends and life when I was stripped from England in '99, and between annual visits, emails filled in the gaps for us. (In retrospect this comments on the history of chat technology, youngsters able to figure it out around the millennium.) An early symbol of my empathetic practice, in 2004 electro-mails I basically asked Dan questions that Pitchfork media was answering. I'm not taking credit for his current success as a reviewing journalist, but I think he relished the task and I gave him plenty of practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This era also marked birth of Garage Band, and I would apply for transatlantic feedback on homemade mp3 which were admittedly variable. Always graciously, he would come back with what went right - a bassline, or a beat - and what to improve on - the melody, the structure, or too much repetition. What a tireless sounding board he was. Fatefully he once sent me the track "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oCWduKu9nk"&gt;3am by Young Jeezy prod. Timbaland.&lt;/a&gt;" along with a break down on the innovative percussive mouth sounds, and the room it had to breathe, the elements that made it pop with contrast. His adulation made me revere this track as a gold standard, and so Dan's unqualified approval of my music became my aim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can trust his opinion because of his dedication to surveying the complete musical landscape. Dan told me about the several spellings of his name that could be used as a different mindsets to approach listening. There was "D-Co" reserved for the Brooklynesque B-boy lifestyle; "Deeko," a UK-funky hypebeast, and "dico," the minimal, experimental Berlin producer.  (I'm probably getting these wrong, but as I will explain later, the memory faults are an intentional part of this series). This level of pan-genricism impressed me deeply. The more Dan spread his taste the more sage and trustworthy his direction was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hung to the album names that he would drop. There was &lt;em&gt;Music Has the Right to Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ege Bamyasi&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Dungen&lt;/em&gt;. Each one felt like a special insight into the the infinite maze of all the possible music there was to listen to. There was also &lt;em&gt;Alopecia&lt;/em&gt; which confirmed a suspicion I had about the size of the infinity that that Maze was. It was growing exponentially, and some of the corners of strange cul-de-sacs were going to contain the gems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's true that I had a predisposition to like the the music that Dan introduced me to because of the intertwining of my need for friendship. But if that told the whole story, I couldn't exceed his appreciation of the media. Mother's can give birth to children more talented than they are in areas. The same is true for my love for Dan, and my obsession with Why?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>U and Why?: Part 2: Snow Bike and the Seven Identities</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/u-and-why-part-2-snow-bike-and-the-seven-identities.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-06T20:36:00-08:00</published><updated>2016-02-06T20:36:00-08:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2016-02-06:/u-and-why-part-2-snow-bike-and-the-seven-identities.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;While Ceephax has exposed me to a hyperactive, ultrajoyful side of myself, Why? has shown me how to cope with inexorable loss of impermanent identities.

Just today I was going to go to an event I'd been looking forward to for over a year; the Stupor Bowl is a 50 mile bike ride in Minneapolis, stopping at 9 bars, and on the coldest day of the year. But after ceding a pool table yesterday to a man who my friends told me looked very much like myself, due to his moustache and cycling jacket, I became paralyzed by the self-awareness of my new identity. Without realising it I was becoming not just a person who rode their bicycle in the winter, but 'a winter cyclist'. A winter cyclist is a person who takes pride in wrestling their bike in a blizzard. There are elements of environmentalism and human vs. nature, but there are greater proportions of fashion, and bro-subculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing the new label I'd taken made me ponder, having moved to North-Midwest-Central-North-America, what has become of the identities I used to hold. I had a lot invested in being: a vegan, a (motor)cyclist, a nudist and burner, a yogi, a feminist, an open source proponent, and being self-employed. None of them have disappeared but they have all become subdued and muted. It's too hard not sharing these identities with my close community in academia. That is a shame. I want to make my life so that it can be easier to uphold those principles, and - very importantly - discover new turn ons. But this isn't about thet future right now. It's about finding yourself surprised to have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## TODO, why no discussion about my self being a white man as identity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Pull up to critical mass in a gas guzzling ford."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?  of course came before and warned me about this moment. Although it's not the stupor bowl but critical mass the reference is still perfect. I recall the first time I heard this lyric in 2012 when "Sod in the Seed" had come out. I was in my living room in Oakland in the height of my critical-massing-going life. Earlier that week I'd had narrowly escaped arrest for a having just feathered over the line of the patience of a cop at the protest. The feeling of invicibility and rebelious youth was fresh. That I was still residually high from the demonstration, and that my rap idol had been there and now was somehow "over" it was a great cognitive disonnance. Now it makes sense, I was forewarned that the atrophy of my dogma in political cycling is natural. Confess your inner feelings with special emphasis on your paradoxes and you'll be free Yoni Wolf had instructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Why? lyric realisation is merely the lesson-du-jour from the band's discography. I recall so many of the first times I've understood a meaning from the backpack rapper that it's becoming burdensome. Here's the lucky part, my obsession with Nicholshon Baker lead me to an experimental treatment outlined in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_and_I:_A_True_Story"&gt;U and I&lt;/a&gt;, a story of his fascination with John Updike. The process calls for a complete ban on media consumption from the subject, then walk through the valley of the shadow of ego death, and find out how the fantasy of being Yoni Wolf has changed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've restrained myself from listenening to any Why? since March 2014, and now I am ready to begin.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>U and Y.

&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQfFuMIQKY0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ceephax Acid Crew&lt;/em&gt; Live youtube video&lt;/a&gt; there's a comment which says "Love that one guy going nuts." And it's true, there is a guy in the front of the crowd feeling the music and letting his body follow. That's not a particularly amazing fact to many people, but to me its a revelation on a virality with which I'm infected. Because just 24 hours earlier, I was that person in the front.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQfFuMIQKY0" style="width:560px !important" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;{=html}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 hours even before I was going nuts, I was getting nervous. Ceephax was playing at the Science Museum in San Francisco, and this would be my first opportunity to see him in the flesh. In that way that turns off your sense of decorum, I wanted to show him just what his music meant to me. My plan was to utilize some Nardwuar-esque deep fan knowlege. What only an unashamed geek would know is that Ceephax is, in addition to his music, a connoisseur of funky-design jumpers and carpets. He used to keep an gallery (that is sadly not online anymore) of the zig-zag neons, sharp-angled bright purples, and multi-coloured galaxy-exploding textiles that pepper our world. The morning before the concert I took time off work to go to the local charity shop to find an outrageous torso-warmer to give as a present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with the most outlandish garment I could scour, I shot to the museum, striding quickly and with purpose. I went alone and being by myself added an anxiety to the mission, I had no social cover, I had to admit my compulsion. I felt the omen in the air and walked my path of mystic discovery. The first rung in the gauntlet was that I had to find Ceephax among the exhibition halls. I asked myself, if I were Ceephax where would I be? Years of surfing forums had prepared me, and quickly found him by the audio hacking station. Here things got harder. Having spotted him from behind, I waited a moment, trying to calculate my next move. Tap on the shoulder? Insert myself into the conversation? What would I say? How much small talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I'm not a shy person, I decided to wait near-by without giving any signals that I wanted chat, uncharacteristically my reverence was guiding me to be polite. That was gravity of the situation. But patience paid off, he got a bit bored and look around - then I pounced, "Hi Andy, I'm Max Klein [hand out for shake]." "Hi" he replied accepting my hand. The next seconds of silence pressed on me as I found my words. "I like your music, and I know you like strange jumpers a lot, so I have a present for you." I handed over the jumper which he tried on immediately. It fit, and he thanked me. Having run out of activity, self-consciousness became crippling, so I slipped away unceremoniously. Later, in a trying-not-to-care, waiting-for-the-show-phase, I saw someone else give him a jumper and he didn't try it on. I took this as the compliment I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceephax was the only act that night. This wasn't a music hall, there was no stage, and the open space was proportioned poorly for a concert. As he played, I danced. The crowd was nerd-full, and they spread themselves out to stand back and nod their heads with ample comfort bubbles. I felt like they were insulting Ceephax, and his 4x4 beats which are meant for moving, and not caring how you do it. I charged front and center, closed my eyes, and started to loosen my hips, my neck, and arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to face the crowd rather than Ceephax, it was too much to look at him while he played. The same phenomena occurs when you ask someone a complex question, they can't look at your face, it's too much information to process human expressions and multiplying digits at the same time. Anyway, I wanted to show my appreciation and that meant no cognition allowed, just embodied pumping, swinging and channelling of the relentless bass. After a track of being alone in a semi-circle radius around the stage, one more super fan joined. I acknowledged them with a micro-nod worked into the jerky dance, and went back to closing my eyes. On the second track, two more joined us, and on the third track another four, etc. until the crowd shifted and agglomerated. The sweat started to flow and the Acid House came alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Acid House? It's an infection. When you get into an Acid House state, it's about riding the wave between human funk and algorithmic machines, and the way that pushes your body's limits. The music gets faster and harder until you think it can't get any faster or harder. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/x0eMgrPPgOk?t=36s"&gt;"We're going to go faster and faster, until you fucking explode."&lt;/a&gt; warns Ceephax . When Ceephax pushes beyond to the volcanic point, the music surpasses mental comprehension, it breaks a sort of barrier, and that's the key freeing moment. At that moment, you can't step to the beat, you have to accept the rules are broken. This is jarring because just moments before you were in a dream listening to very predictable lullaby melodies. If you're suddenly uncomfortable without the tropes of ancient greek aestheticism this will be frustrating. If you understand the game, you revel in the lawlessness of this temporary zone where the only context is pure chaos and it doesn't matter at all what your limbs do next, so you may as well try and do something very odd with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I reached acid-house-nirvana several times. I binged on Ceephax, and my body was flushed off the pent up tension of acting acceptably in polite society. Being spent, I was ready to restore normality. Which was why at the end, when the DJ in the admiral hat told me that he was playing an unannounced underground rave the next night in my stomping grounds of Oakland, I felt like I couldn't step through that next portal. But I knew I had to go, even though I had completely expended myself as if it all ended tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So a day later, I found myself bicycling to "Babeland" in Chinatown, an unsuspecting apartment-cum-venue for a night, in an unassuming part of Oakland. This was exactly the sort of place I wanted to see Ceephax, it was as grungy and unpretentious as possible. Upstairs there was an art installation with a playable NES whose visuals were distorted by filters, and the bar was serving rainbow-flavoured ice-cream for \$1 per scoop. Underneath was the "stage" which was a folding table in garage located at the end of a squeeze-through hall way. Fire standards would mandate no more than 20 people in the room. Maximum bus-in-the-rain capacity was probably 40 people shoulder-to-shoulder. There were probably 50 humans, and the 8 foot ceiling made is seem like even more. Once again I worked my way to the front to get in position for adulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any beginning Ceephaxer knows that part of his magic is that he doesn't use computers to generate sound, only dedicated music equipment like synthesizers. I turned to the person next to me in painted-on white jeans and tie-dye and tried to engage the subject. "Sometimes I like to listen to just drum machine and synths," I tried to impress. "Sometimes I like to just listen to drum machine" he retorted. It was a clever one-up, and right then I knew I was in the right place. What transpired that night was an ego-melting sacred ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I didn't need to prove to the crowd that they should get close and dance their brains stupid. From the start there were only two classes of standing room: whether you could tell when Ceephax last showered, or whether you could discern the spice mix of his last meal. That was accompanied by the flipped script of the standard U.S. not talking to strangers. Somebody recognized me from the night before, put his arm around me and said with his eyes "Welcome. You didn't know you were one of us did you? It's OK, its hard to admit at first, but you're among friends now". So we went on adventure together, it was called Ceephax going absolutely HAM. The experience encompassed me completely, the physical arrangement, the feeling of familial safety, the deafening trance. Best of all I didn't need to feel shame for liking it. The more we gyrated and spasmed, the more life outside went from inconsequential to not existing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wave started to swell. The cadence quickened and the tracks became more layered and punchy. We coming up to the acid edge. But just about when the hyperdrive was about to engage an unexpected twist came. Ceephax fumbled a button, and the machines started firing all at once. It was mayhem, and fate beyond any of our freewill. You could see Ceephax exasperated, not being able to turn them off. It didn't sound "good", unsync'd beats were colliding akwardly. Yet at the same time it was amazing. We were already too high on snare-rushes and melodies that going from "A to B to X" was just more scenery on our milky way journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all over when there were no more encores left to give. In the absence the dominating feeling was a palpable camaraderie. We were tied together by ringing in ears and shirts that we were struggling to get off because they were soaked through. Our physical condition left us in no state to even communicate, we could only muster "very good" in reply to "good" when we saw each other with wide smiles. After half an hour basking in the good vibes around smoking circles outside I slumped my way to my bicycle. On the ride home as my brain started to reverted to normalcy I began to wonder about this hyperstimulation, and what my susceptibility to it meant. I wondered if I had undiagnosed epilepsy? I called my Mum the next day to see she had ever thought I shown signs of autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still listen to Ceephax a lot, but beyond these concerts I can recount only 2 memorable instances of Ceephax. Once at rave in the woods in north of Berlin, where a few people got into it until some men who were very serious about their brand of house told me to turn it off. The other was at Burning Man when even my lax campmates actually preferred to go to bed than take it any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceephax Acid Crew is #2 on my list of music and associated transcendental experiences. Why? is the first by an order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Differently Shaped Virtual Paper</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/differently-shaped-virtual-paper.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-06T17:04:00-08:00</published><updated>2015-12-06T17:04:00-08:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2015-12-06:/differently-shaped-virtual-paper.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The very first time I heard it I was immediately convinced by Killer Mike's un-festschrift "Reagan".

&lt;p&gt;This week my &lt;a href="http://nsfgrfp.org/"&gt;National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt; application was "rejected without review." The reason given was my application was not conforming to the submission standards, I hadn't left 1 inch margins. It was true, I'd left 2cm margins (0.79 inches). It wasn't a conscious decision, it was just technology ruling my life. As I keep Ubuntu's language set to British English to avoid too many red underline squiggles in my life - Libre Office had defaulted to A4 papersize when I went to write my document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#A_series"&gt;A-series of paper sizes&lt;/a&gt;, is a rather clever invention if you've not learned about it's geometry. Each A&lt;em&gt;(n)&lt;/em&gt; size is derived by folding A&lt;em&gt;(n-1)&lt;/em&gt; in half AND every A&lt;em&gt;(n)&lt;/em&gt; has exactly the same ratio of height to width 1:√2. The math is elegant. Fold 1:√2 in half and get 1:(√2 / 2) . Simplify by multiplying both sides by √2, and get √2*1: √2*(√2 / 2) √2:(2/2) = √2:1. Ingenious.  8½" by 11" on the other hand is about &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192919/http://www.afandpa.org/paper.aspx?id=511"&gt;Ronald Reagans's domination and monocultural hegemony.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is that there are  subtle ways that technology decides our lives. Sometimes they are about automatic defaults in open source software; other times its about how bureaucratic rule, leads to governments codifying their cruel procedural-focus &lt;a href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/34-dmv-nation/"&gt;into even worse websites&lt;/a&gt;.

The Nation Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSFGRFP)  supports new PhD students in their research aims for 3 years.  And I am told, and also suppose, that I want that. The way in which they ask you to prostrate is a standard multi-essay plus recommendations mode. The essays, when viewed as "papers for which you haven't done the work," were useful writing and thought exercises. I am quite energized by firming up a proposal about what I might do in the next three years, even if it seems incomprehensibly difficult and moon-shot-ish  right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.theclimatecode.com/p/asdasd.html"&gt;climate code&lt;/a&gt; suggested that I ought to show how my research could have "multiple returns on investment." I would like it if my application did as well. Perhaps publishing them in full here will have some good consequence in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Graduate Research Plan Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blindspot: A Passive Implicit Bias Test From Digital Footprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender, race, sexuality, nationality, social-class, native-language, weight, etc. are causes of implicit and explicit social biases that affect human relationships, and in the worse case make life difficult for many.  For example, identical academic resumés with men's names get offered more jobs with higher starting salaries than women's (Moss-Racusin et al.). Similarly, physicians show a bias to attribute patient’s symptoms to coronary disease for blacks more than whites. Invetiably, social technologies transfer these biases (Friedman et al.), but their design can mitigate or exacerbate the transfer. In a negative example, photography tools have been optimized for taking pictures of white people (Dyer).  Meanwhile the internet has been a boon to the Gay Liberation movement by connecting people without fear of homophobia (Weinrich). However, the Human-Computer Interaction literature does not address these issues much (Kannabiran et al). That is a problem because social technology is an ever-growing component of our lives, and implicit biases are subtext to every transaction. Implicit bias is difficult to recognize because it cannot be seen with introspection (Kang, et al.). Without taking an implicit bias test one may remain unaware of the problem, and currently those tests require time and effort. &lt;strong&gt;I propose to build easier, more integrated, passive implicit bias tests by utilizing a person's digital footprint.&lt;/strong&gt; This proposal involves three parts; to operationalize bias from passive data, to create tools using that operationalization, and finally to evaluate those tools with a field study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 1: Operationalize bias from passive data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first issue to tackle with this general approach is to be able to compute the implicit bias of a behaviour. The state of the art is the Implicit Association Test “IAT” (Greenwald et al. 1995), an isolated test-taking activity. My plan is to improve on the test by applying the notion to a person's passive behaviour. I ask: can we treat the time reading combined topics as a passive test? For instance, if we know the content of a browsing history, and the time spent on each article, perhaps we already have the results of an implicit bias test. To evaluate the merit of our passive test we will correlate results with the IAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing user and global biases I have been making inroads. In a recent project I built gender inequality indexes from the biographies of all Wikipedias by nationality. One result from this is that there is a high correlation between the nationality-index and the United Nation's inequality index. As the UN measures inequality by position of power and education levels in countries, we know that so too do Wikipedia editors. I presented this finding at OpenSym '15 (Klein), and continuation of the work is now supported by a Wikimedia Foundation grant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also experienced in finding novel measures for human behaviour. Borrowing from the economics literature I have suggested a measure of “collaborativeness” of a group of Wikipedia editors based on the articles they edit (Klein et al.). This is also an implicit bias check of sorts, it looks at the underlying propensity for users to collaborate, based on how different they are from a global norm. My familiarity with social bias data and repurposing methods will be key in building a theory of passive implicit bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 2: Create tools using that operationalization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I develop a way to compute an implicit bias from a set of web pages, I would build a tool to allow any web user to monitor themselves. I envision this taking the form of a browser plug-in, that will, with permission, read and track your browser history. I will use the linked open data of the web - Wikidata, Freebase etc. - which provides semantic information on the internet at large for a “ground truth”. For instance if you are reading New York Times Opinion Pages, we will infer the amount of time spent reading about U.S. prison reform (domestic-interest &amp;amp; Police Chief Garry McCarthy, male, age 56) vs. Canada's Muslims in the upcoming election (foreign-interest, Muslim-interest, &amp;amp; political elections). Over the scale on an entire browsing history, we can sum the time spent on and between different dimensions of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quell the issue of potential privacy violations this tool will be entirely open source, something with which I’m well acquainted. For instance I created a monitoring service which watches every edit on Wikipedia in realtime for citations, pings the author of the citation, and uploads any open access articles for link reliability. Seeing the benefit in this Crossref offered financial support to expand and maintain this service (Bilder). Thus my skills in building realtime tools for social good is already advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 3: Evaluate those tools with a field study&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last stage of this proposal would be to conduct a field study of how well this implicit bias tool works. We would seek a stratified sample to install and use the browser plugin. Next, we would monitor participants at intervals, determining if being aware of their bias scores affects their future bias score. We must control for factors such as having browsing history monitored, and the frequency of seeing implicit bias scores. To test the method’s efficacy we would correlate results with standard implicit bias scores. I am at the beginning of my training in conducting field study. This is why I chose my advisor Dr. Haiyi Zhu, a computer scientist with ample experience in the area. At the moment we are embarking on an interview study on Couchsurfing and AirBnB, in which I am learning the interview skills and interactive methods crucial to field study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work put together - successful or not - would advance the fields of human-centered computer science and implicit social bias research. Our first step, to create a passive implicit bias test based on a digital footprint, will contribute by improving implicit bias measurement methods. Our tool-building will provide another return on investment by enriching the linked-open-data community with an open bias dataset, a dimension at the moment which is entirely missing. In total, the project successfully completed would mean a novel, unprecedentedly easy implicit bias check, usable by anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proposed work can help unlock technology’s potential to reduce implicit social bias (e.g.,  gender, race, sexuality, nationality) and equalize society. We are attempting to build a “one-click solution”, so that time and technical barriers to test one’s own implication are as low as possible. Thus the broadest swathe of society will be able look into a mirror of their own bias. Yet, another aspect of creating a more equal society lies in access to research. As someone that was an unaffiliated researcher before re-entering the academy, I know the value of Open Access work, as it was all I had for years. I have a data management plan in place to publish all papers and non-privacy-sensitive documents (including this one), under open licenses. I am already an attender of Open Knowledge Festival, and was a Featured Speaker at Wikimania 2015. By advocating for open access research I’m promoting the spread of knowledge above prestige and profit, and eventually a more egalitarian world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Personal, Relevant Background and Future Goals Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Attack On My Belief-System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of the reality of social biases was a turning point in my life. The first time I awoke to my implicit, internalised racism a mix of discomfort and amazement overcame me. It was during a protest on the civil-rights-famous steps of Sproul Hall in Berkeley, where after a few rebel-rousing speeches a black woman came to the stage and started delivering activist poetry. I had been brought up to think of myself as not racist, and yet in a rare moment of self-awareness I saw myself dismissing her content because of how she spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the world-shattering realization of how we can hide prejudices from ourselves, subsequent prejudices came to light more rapidly. My own misogyny became very real upon a reading of favourite academic Joseph Reagle's “&lt;a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/4291/3381"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free as in Sexist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; (Reagle) a deconstruction of sexism in Open Culture. (Of course it took a man to show me that.) I lost religious dogma at the holocaust memorials in Berlin and Auschwitz, when I saw that accepting any unquestioned message is dangerous. Only last month the &lt;a href="http://talkinreckless.com/"&gt;blog of a woman&lt;/a&gt; I met at a wedding introduced me to the “fat stigma” I had unwittingly been harbouring (“Talkin Reckless”). These continuous epiphanies fuel my wonder at just how many unidentified stigmas I'm still holding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling I get from a solid attack on my belief-system is so powerful that chasing after it has become the driving force in my life. Now I want it to be my career. I want to use research methods promote a more equitable society by uncovering and addressing implicit stigmas. I foresee my future as working with an organization or think-tank, likely non-profit, who also focuses on equality issues. Whether by grant or employment, it is of paramount importance that I work with a social justice-oriented team. My past experience in working in that sector has been overwhelmingly positive. Yet owing to the fact that this line of work is more self-directed and typically outside large corporate structure, advancing my career will mean I need to become more independent as researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having worked as a self-employed developer and researcher the last two years, I see graduate studies as a best path to enabling my personal development. Past experience has shown me that I need to learn a larger swathe of research methods. For my particular project - building a tool to unearth implicit bias from browsing habits - I need to learn the ways in which people are best convinced. And I am also looking for graduate school to partner me with others doing similar things. Together, mastering technical methods, delving into psychology, and working within the landscape, will give my goal of exposing implicit bias the broadest possible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I learned how to both borrow and re-use theory from other fields, and to take initiative on projects during my work on “The Virtuous Circle of Wikipedia” (Klein et al.).&lt;/strong&gt; While volunteering at the Wikipedia booth during a poster session at UC Berkeley, a conversation quickly turned into a collaboration.  An economist asked me to provide Wikipedia data for testing economic complexity theory in that domain. Being mentored by my coauthor Maillart – who would describe himself as an “econo-physicist” – I  learned what it means to generalize findings and theories across domains. That has been an inspiration, as I now see the rich potential of exploring and reading outside computer science. The story continues as I also understood more about research collaboration dynamics. When the project started slipping behind schedule, I took the initiative to create a plan to finish on time by managing my superiors, assigning them task-lists, as well as plowing on with the  analysis myself. Thus they awarded me with first-authorship on the paper. That has brought me to the next challenge of completely leading a research effort, which I think graduate school can teach me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am prepared to manage a team, but see my relative paucity in methods of persuasion from “Wikipedia Indicators of Gender Inequality (WIGI)” (Klein and Konieczny), a grant&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I won from Wikimedia Foundation.&lt;/strong&gt; The aim of WIGI is to provide a series of inequality indexes like the United Nations Gender Inequality Index based off Wikipedia and including time, ethnicity, and occupation dimensions. When correlated to other indexes it can tell us both about the world and Wikipedia (Klein). On the back of that poster and paper, I won a grant from the Wikimedia Foundation to make the dataset available as a service. As the principal grantee, I manage a paid team of 4, which has taught me the lessons of how to lead without pushing. At first I erred in being to Laissez-faire in trusting employees to be self-directed, and later settle on a more accountable weekly-homework model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've produced a &lt;a href="https://github.com/notconfusing/WIGI"&gt;prototype&lt;/a&gt;, which will make it much easier for other researchers to include inequality as a dimension in their projects. Yet, even though we have made this dataset, I am still at quite a loss of how to announce it and persuasively “sell” the research – another skill that graduate school can teach me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having been engaged in exemplary models of collaboration during my time as Research Assistant at OCLC, and a grantee of Creative Commons, I know the value of community.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you want to go fast you go alone; if you want to go far you go together,” I recall the CEO Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) saying in a company address. Founded in 1967, they are ancient by tech standards, but their long-term vision taught me what it meant to me a community member. During my time there as a research assistant I found an opportunity to use their bibliographic data to enrich Wikipedia's articles. Having racked up over 2 million edits, I published about the process with help from the tight-knit librarian community (Klein and Kyrios).  My experience from OCLC in thinking about multiple stakeholders, and industry standards, is how I came to win a grant from Creative Commons to create a plug-in to include the technology of the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI) in MediaWiki sites. Working with the LRMI board, and MediaWiki developers closely, we came to a win-win implementation, that will make highly searchable Google results of Open Educational Resources (Campbell). It was a big lesson to work with many people, but that sometimes slower pace pays off in the longevity of results. With my graduate studies I hope to find a network of colleagues with whom “to go far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping sight of my overall goal to spread awareness of implicit bias, it is easy to explain how the trajectory of my experience will make a broad impact in society. Being privy to your own blind-spots, is difficult, if not paradox by definition. Yet, it is that difficulty which makes it such a worthy project. In fact to the western rationalist mind, paradox is often an indicator of faulty underpinnings. Those who are least affected by implicit bias are, not by coincidence, the most privileged in society. And the most privileged in society have an opportunity to change it. As someone who, more than not, is privileged, I feel it my responsibility to use my position, potential, and energy to continue bring the issue of inequality to light. There is no need for me to &lt;em&gt;translate&lt;/em&gt; how my work and history will broadly impact society, because my work and history &lt;em&gt;is about&lt;/em&gt; the broad unequal impacts in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;On the spine, "The full glory of nature’s ingenuity is apparent in the human spine…From an engineering perspective it is clear that we have the smallest base of support, the highest center of gravity, and the heaviest cranium (proportional to our body weight) of any other mammal.  As the only true bipeds on the planet, we are also earth’s least mechanically stable creatures."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On breathing, "The energy expended in breathing produces a shape change that lowers the pressure in the chest cavity and permits the air to be pushed into the body by the weight of the planet's atmosphere. In other words, you create the space and the universe fills it."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paraphrase on hand balances, "4/5th of the foot is dedicated to weight-bearing  and 1/5th is dedicated to dexterity. The hand (on the other hand) is 1/5th weight-bearing, 4/5th dexterous."&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;"Each bodily movement is embedded in a chain of infinite happenings from which we distinguish only the immediate steps and, occasionally, those which immediately follow… In every trace form created by the body, both infinity and eternity are hidden."&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't recall the provenance of these quotes sadly. Let me know if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"The idea that we are ever not moving is an illusion."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"asana is a process not a product otherwise we could say 'not in a pose' if head isn't touching knee, but that is false."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'Yoga' has the root 'Yuj' which is the root for the English word 'Yoke.'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like humans, "water is transparent and reflective but don't see those properties when in motion."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"If you feel like you're being inauthentic start telling the truth."&lt;/li&gt;

But when &lt;a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~atwu/firstcultural/fci_main.html"&gt;Alfred Twu&lt;/a&gt; speaks, I listen, so if when announced his own fresh take on board gaming my ears piqued and my credit card edged ever so slightly out of my pocket. &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1700980409/high-speed-rail-board-game"&gt;High Speed Rail: The Board Game&lt;/a&gt; emerged from &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/06/us-high-speed-rail-network-possible"&gt;High Speed Rail: The Map, of Guardian Fame&lt;/a&gt;. Neither the map or game, have rooted in any material claim to reality, but most things that inflame your imagination don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/californiarailmap/us-high-speed-rail-system"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://5780613a-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/californiarailmap/us-high-speed-rail-system/US-High-Speed-Rail-System-by-FirstCultural-2013-02-03.png?attachauth=ANoY7coZa8WBXJlVc0dcnBWx15wheGZJs-CpqET_vo2P7hiA13v-UB64BgcRAemaXKdxoHI4t4GAk_btd7QDXdqqg56wg3kJOT7ZOzKao186tmWva1ed7lJ-60aFpwKbs5rUh7uMh_530ubnQsGfErvSDC4clkpkD1UD_7-tXVdhMkRwm6eKve-alb6YBFzuj_CW7l4J0xzgvcC7VMebsLrat6IuEINEtzM6789_lnfOhaC8BiUI3Xc3REfg2albRYqUc_kTQB1KAHndNe7kiEb4d4qgSuo1-bzfGt2yjJWwEjHnLLPnNJAs1PPb08ahoSH9y5i_LEFu&amp;amp;attredirects=0" style="width:1280px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; High Speed Rail: The Map&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The \$15 printed on overhead transparency version arrived at my house a few days ago (versions go up to \$100 with glass pieces). And last night 6 of us maxed-out the player count and sat down to squabble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/10/IMG_20141026_210214253.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Foxy Pigeon Cottage Navigating the Fraught Ways of High Speed Rail Voters" class="size-large wp-image-3563" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/10/IMG_20141026_210214253.jpg" style="width:474px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Foxy Pigeon Cottage Navigating the Fraught Ways of High Speed Rail Voters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, there was rather little squabbling, and that completely changed my mind about what board games can be. The key thing to know about the HSR, is that you can't move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is that you are given 3 objectives, of the type "Logistics Industry: Connect 2 of the 3 Cities - Detroit, Houston, San Diego". Then you have to place tiles to realize your rail network - except as I mentioned - you're not allowed to place tiles. Rather when it's &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; turn, everybody else will place a tile as a &lt;em&gt;proposal&lt;/em&gt;, and you will select another player's proposal (or 2 proposals at a time for a 5+ player game).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that all your strategy comes by way of surveying other player's objectives and finding the most mutual ground with them. This is slightly complicated by the fact that only 2 of the objective cards are publicly shown, and the 3rd one is kept secret. Barring this small niggle the games is not competitive at all, you are constantly trying to find compromising ground - in some ways a very realistic,  and in others a very unrealistic version of democracy in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike most games, I didn't feel frustrated for having lost to unfair rules, or scheming opponents. It wasn't too long, only about 45 minutes (and it was everyone's first time playing).  To play is to softly massage an unfolding  system. The game has CC-BY-SA logos on all the pieces, and everyone is mostly cooperating. High Speed Rail is the nobly amateur, egalitarian pastime that would be played in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotopia"&gt;Ecotopia.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

HackerSchool is part of the wave of "Hacker Education," where you exchange something with a company for programming education. HackerSchool differentiates in that you don't pay them upfront, or necessarily at all - they just want a cut of a potential recruiting bonus when they pawn you to another company. They also have good perspectives on &lt;a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules"&gt;lightweight social rules&lt;/a&gt; and gender equality which piqued me.  Still, let us not mince, this is private education. A more dedicated Hacker might call it a co-option of DIY, gift-economy culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this might seem a bitter and fruitless retaliation in response to a rejection letter, that is only the first lily-pad. In fact, there is something more that made HackerSchool particularly attractive to me, which only became apparent in retrospect. As I wrote in my application (which is copied in its entirety below), and &lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/lessons-from-dogsitting-the-necessary-collar/" title="Lessons from Dogsitting: The Necessary Collar"&gt;previously about dogs&lt;/a&gt;, a central conundrum for me is not knowing how to work for myself. I can work to impress authorities, appear clever for narcissistic purposes, or for fear of failure - but not because I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HackerSchool's "everyone determines their own lesson plan" philosophy could be a vital stepping stone to a dreamed-of autodidacticism. On the face of it, going to HackerSchool even looks like genuine autodidacticism. But closer inspection would reveal that you have an authority (the HackerSchool institution) that instructs you to teach yourself. The outer loop, the most meta-level, is still a deference to a force that isn't your own. It's virtualizing self-ownership, which is really just &lt;a href="http://invisiblethingslab.com/resources/bh08/part3.pdf"&gt;"bluepilling"&lt;/a&gt; yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/07/pill.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="It's virtualizing self-ownership, which is really just " class="size-medium wp-image-3508" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/07/pill.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It's virtualizing self-ownership, which is really just "bluepilling" yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conflict arose during my 14 minute interview with  the organizers, in the question of "how would I learn," my favoured topics? "I suppose, I would use textbook as in College," I replied without confidence, and later amended to "but typically it's been project-needs plus stackoverflow."  In both cases I now see I pointed to historic examples where the main motivator was either a professor or boss. Unsurprisingly this was a lacking answer to both myself, and an interviewer not looking to be my professor or boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for positive cases of escaping this servitude, there is obviously one classical logic. Accomplishment-desire drives non-authority-pleasing mechanisms of work. But what if we allow that natural curiosity is not the only way to exit the teach-yourself-to-teach-yourself paradox. What could be alternatives? We could use as a starting point the &lt;a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=goal+versus+process&amp;amp;t=canonical"&gt;goal vs. process&lt;/a&gt; attitude dichotomy. In this framework the ravenous prodigy sits neatly on the "goal" side. And on the other side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn't a prominent model to represent the unspurred, successful process-worshipper. The best exmaples I can offer are probably something like Aaron Schwartz, &lt;a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q117346#sitelinks-wikipedia"&gt;Grigori Perelman&lt;/a&gt;, or a stereotypical monk. Having such a dearth of role models is probably because process-oriented people aren't highly lauded in our prize-counting society, and are thus non-notable. This is a dead-end I feel I've been running into frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusive feeling here is not directed, but is still a redoubling of effort. It's a large, and still partially free internet out there. There's Open Access research to read and write, and Open Source code to execute and develop. Even without the promise of coming to an epiphany of how not to get depressed about the fact that I do it alone in my bedroom, that unlit corridor still calls to me as the one with light at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please link to a program you've written from scratch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can use something like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub's gist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;to host your code. It doesn't need to be long, but it should be something you've written yourself, and not using a framework (e.g., Rails). If you don't have anything to submit, code something small, like a game of tic-tac-toe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial translates an Economic algorithm into Python. In short, it does some matrix-calculations, statistical analysis, and some plotting. Its most advanced language-feature is a python “generator.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/notconfusing/wiki_econ_capability/blob/master/Method%20of%20Reflections%20Explained%20and%20Exampled.ipynb"&gt;http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/notconfusing/wiki_econ_capability/blob/master/Method%20of%20Reflections%20Explained%20and%20Exampled.ipynb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This doesn't have to be about programming.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know a averaged crowd of fair-goers can guess the weight of a heifer more accurately than any of the individual simpletons among them. Science shows the principle extends to marbles and encyclopedias as well. But what I picked up this month at the Network Science Conference ‘14, was that it can be applied to stock trading too. Diversification strategies work - but they can also be diversified. A team of researchers explained a technique that they simulated. If you followed x traders, mimicking exactly the trades they perform, but with 1/x of your money, then for sufficiently high x, the return is higher than any of the individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network science bit comes in because you don’t want anyone you follow to be following each other. For the highest return on investment, those who you follow should have “no common ancestors,” in network parlance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More so than stock trading, the “wisdom of the crowds” theory appeals to me. Trying to make clever stock decisions is a huge industry, and this intuitive simple mechanism can compete with more complex ones. What’s fascinating here to me is how theories can unexpectedly translate between domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you want to be doing in two years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years from now I would like be swimming through the gooey centre of a large research project at a think tank or in research and development. Stemming from my previous employment at OCLC Research (a library think tank), I enjoy the freedom of blue-sky thinking. Therefore the employers that have a large enough budget for pure research (Microsoft Research is a good example of this) are the competitive waters that I want to compete in. Having such lofty dreams are never regrettable in my experience because there are always failsafes. In this case one can always sell oneself as a Data Analyst for business intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enjoy any future work however it would be crucial for me to be in a team of stellar collaborators. My personal adage (which I stole from a guy that works in a copy shop) is “life is the water cool, the water cooler is life.” Being around people ignites my mind (even at the copy shop), and I want to continue fuelling that fire. I will continue to invite uncomfortable differences in perspective. Therefore in two years I want to be in a team that values learning over goals. Goals inevitably follow learning - but not vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you want to do Hacker School?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see Hacker School as the centre part of a venn diagram of my desires which are (1) learning self-directedly (2) being part of a supporting group, and (3) boosting employment opportunity after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year when I went to my boss and asked her to crack the whip on me harder, my own actions perplexed me. I quit my job to attack the problem of relying on authority to motivate my work. But next came the paradox: how can one self-direct one’s self to autodidactically become self-directed? Recursion without a base case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a pragmatic perspective I still go to my local hackerspace because I enjoy what could be termed as “co-learning.” The social environment drives me. Being conscious of your impression on others, can psychologically push you to work. It’s not self-actualizing alone in your bedroom, but it’s effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacker school seems like a realpolitik compromise between bootstrapping self-ownership, and well-proved social dynamics. Given that Hacker School can also help with the personally-dreaded task of a job-search after, I see a trifecta being won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you like to work on at Hacker School?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E.g., things you want to learn or understand better, projects you want to build or contribute to, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a few pet-projects that jump to mind, none are as important as the process of the work I might do. Rather than pronounce any work in detail, I would describe my desires declaratively. There are two main criteria. Firstly, like a carrot just beyond horse-mouth's reach, I want to find a project that is harder than I expect, simply to level-up. Secondly, is to overcome the folly of the lone-inventor myth. To horizontally work with a partner is as important as being the bringer of the techno-revolution. So the thing I would like to work on is a new idea I would receive while I’m at Hacker School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, in absence of any external input, a few of the topics I want to understand better are machine learning, genetic algorithms, and pattern recognition. These corners of computer science are somehow just cool. Pursuing them, since they are substantially complex seems commensurate with Hacker School motto of “get dramatically better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also I want to be able to make my phone turn off silent mode by sending it a secret text for those hidden-under-couch situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This information&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;disqualify your application. We use it to better get to know our applicants and where they currently are. If you're worried that you won't fit into Hacker School, you can read about&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/alumni_profiles"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some of our alumni&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describe your programming background in a few sentences.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2006. Failed Java in Community College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2009. Discover I enjoyed programming Turing Machines on paper in "Computability Theory" in my Pure Math major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010. Enroll in – and revel in – the purity of the Berkeley/MIT Scheme tradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011. Fail Java again. Tech career funeral and wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012. Phoenixed with Python + Stackoverflow, to write Wikipedia bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2013. Welcome to the FOSS movement. Linux and git start unpacking in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014. Hacker School&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you worked professionally as a programmer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If so, please describe your experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in programming and working hard at reinventing the idea of a “professional” programmer have been the last three years of my life. When I was “Wikipedian-in-Residence” I turned my job into programming by convincing management of my proposed bot-writing projects. In my own business I’ve won contracts to deliver reports that were the result of custom programs. So although I’ve never worked as a typical professional programmer, I like my life to be about delivering code for pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from University of California Berkeley, and have applied and furthered my Computer Science knowledge outside of academia. In the far future I have considered enrolling in a  Master’s or PhD program. My draw towards a heavily mathematical emphasis looms. From my work with Wikipedia, a more human and social element has nestled in my head. Therefore it’s possible that my interests would converge in Computer Science degree.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Morten's Rule of Airports</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/mortens-rule-of-airports.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-09T05:49:00-07:00</published><updated>2014-06-09T05:49:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2014-06-09:/mortens-rule-of-airports.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;Morten's Rule of Airports&lt;/strong&gt;, it's history, and some of its benefits.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or for those of you who read nerd:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/06/morten_math.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="morten_math" class="aligncenter wp-image-669" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/06/morten_math.png" style="width:600px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Origins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an expedition to see my friend Morten in British Colombia, in which I was struggling with travel-stress, I was struck by a story of enlightened travelling genius. Morten told of a tale where a flight of his was delayed at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris by several hours. It was an inconvenience because he was missing appointments for work and with friends in Denmark. He was getting stressed when he overheard a couple that were vocally calculating the time it would take to get to the city centre and back. Even with reasonable train delay buffers the journey would still leave them with 1 hour and 5 minutes in Paris. While it seemed a bit ludicrous to go for just 1 hour and 5 minutes, there wasn't much else to do, so he boarded the shuttle, and set off mostly aimlessly. In his 65 minutes, he bought a croissant and a coffee and sat and pondered. A state of relaxation and bliss came over him, he relates. It was just atmosphere soaking, but it was real - especially compared to the departure lounge. On returning to the airport with the planned buffer in tact, he wrote to all his missed appointments that he was really sorry to miss their meetings. To his friend he recounted his hour of cosmically-displaced croissant munching and a restored inner peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impressed very much by this story at the time, I've decided to honour it. Therefore I have abstracted its principle and named it after its originator. You can help me to codify this rule by implementing it in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked this talk when I last stopped over in London. Landing at 8am, and taking off again at 2pm, I counted an hour's travel in each direction and the need to be two hours early.  I was still left with 14-8-1-1-2 = 2 hours of freedom. At first I expected to do nothing besides my normal coffee and journalling  ritual. Yet, stepping out of Victoria station and on my way to hunting down a Costa's, I encountered a City Cycle Hire. My plans changed in that instant, and after the nuisance of accepting all liability for my own dangerous cycling behaviour, out clicked a 3-speed indestructible 2-wheeler. Then with a buzzing smile across my face, I intrepidly raced to Buckingham Palace, Nelson's Column, St. James Park,  and the Houses of Parliament with the goal of trying to get a fast-forward visual-effect through speed. Later I topped-up a SIM called an old friend for 13 mins 36 seconds,  and guzzled a Strongbow at 11am opening time. It was a brilliant interlude, providing adventure, exercise, and chemical euphoria in a condensed movie-long wander. Far better than purposelessly zooming in and out on the display cameras at the unbranded electronics shop (which I still did for 20 minutes anyway, but 60). I hope you are as convinced as I was to get out and enjoy the only-marginally but still better activities that are available in the open-air tourist traps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact I had great joy at playing the fool as I asked a someone to take a picture of my luggaged self, and received this appalling shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/06/nelsonstrunk.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="nelsonstrunk" class="wp-image-677 size-medium" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/06/nelsonstrunk.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Appalling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did however this piece of poetry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture was cropped&lt;br&gt;
by the tourist-photographer.&lt;br&gt;
The subject was photographed&lt;br&gt;
by Nelson's trunk.&lt;/p&gt;

Myself (left) with two of the fabulous design team, May (centre) and Yufei (right).[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With free pizza proffed, the UX team Jared Zimmerman, May Galloway, and Yufei Liu, (pictured right) launched right into the need for these new set of icons, or "marks" as they are calling them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current logos don't scale to 16 pixels square, and don't overlay well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To distinguish links to wikimedia sites on non-wikimedia sites.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other sites have "social media" icons which if a brand is big enough replace a text link. Think facebook "f", or twitter's "t".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, there was an intriguing mock-up which displayed twitter having a special preview of a link to Wikipedia, much like they treat youtube links specially.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attribution to wikimedia content is verbose and cumbersome, and could be wrapped into an iconic link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm convinced. Just like there are "post to facebook" buttons polluting the internet, there may as well be "read on Wikipedia" icons to restore some balance to the universe. Even though it's minor, the attribution point is also valid. When I want to attribute commons - like I do on other parts of this blog - well all that copypasta is half of my repetitive strain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before continuing to show you what these marks actually look like, allow me to appease the User Experience team by disclaiming these disclaimers about the designs you are about to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not replacements.&lt;/strong&gt; The marks are not meant to be replacements for the current logos (don't call these logos). They are in-addition-to what we already have, and for others to use when pointing links to or mentioning Wikmedia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not final.&lt;/strong&gt; The marks shown here are not final, they are open for community review and scrutiny. I trust them because they sat quietly as I bombasted how the Wikpedia mark looks like it's from M*A*S*H.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not forced.&lt;/strong&gt; The marks will not be forced on the community. There will be a Request for Comment, and the outcome of that RfC will decide the fate of this project. Wikimedia Foundation is not making anyone do anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/wikipedia.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wikipedia. While the tangram looks like it should be sent back to the army's crate-stenciling department, the path is pure Ikea, self-explaining simplicity." class="wp-image-620 size-medium" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/wikipedia.jpg" style="width:153px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Wikipedia. While the tangram looks like it should be sent back to the army's crate-stenciling department, the path is pure Ikea, self-explaining simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

But I don't think you can beat it for recognizability. Notice in the Path, the lower semi circle motif turns into hand adjusting the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that said we can proceed to analysing the design language, of which there are two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tangram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first of the two languages, which in these images are the upper row, is called "Tangram". &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram"&gt;A tangram&lt;/a&gt; (oh look there's a link to Wikipedia, which wordpress could render with a small mark next to it) is a Chinese toy or puzzle, that consists of rearranging certain primitive shapes. All the tangram marks can be made by rearranging four shapes (sadly not pictured here). The tangram series is more "metaphoric" to use the UX team's words. Although the Wikipedia mark, still a "W", is not metaphoric as a notable exception. It's also the simpler of the two series. Often times making out the meaning is a bit more oblique, but easier to see once the meaning is pointed out, which I do in the captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Path&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Path, shown in the lower row, is the more complicated set of the two. The UX team still says that these will work at 16 by 16 px. They are described as having a sketchier feel, and were explained to preserve the &lt;em&gt;circular&lt;/em&gt; nature that exists in the current logos. Path's meanings are more literal, and thus easier to decipher at first glance, which Jared Zimmerman said, almost regrettably, will bias people to like them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure you have many comments because this is close to a bikeshedding sort of discussion, but that is good because the UX team want your feedback. So make sure you send it to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jaredzimmerman_%28WMF%29"&gt;right&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/User:MGalloway_%28WMF%29"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you may enjoy your sneak peek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Solomon Klajnbaum, born 1880, from Zwolen, a Russian subject."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 30 of April 2014, having flown to Poland, we took the last leg to Zwoleń for Krakow, by way of hired private tour guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: very unfortunately our main camera was stolen later on in Poland, so here I stitch together what I can from camera phones, Google Street View screencaptures, and &lt;a href="http://deathcamps.org/occupation/zwolen.html"&gt;http://deathcamps.org/occupation/zwolen.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guide and driver was Marta, of Rick Steve-recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/4-Marta_Chmielowska2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Marta, the Guide" class="size-medium wp-image-505" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/4-Marta_Chmielowska2.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Marta, the Guide&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't find Marta through Rick Steve, but the recommendation was easy to understand - Marta was as enthusiastic and curious about our story and all Polish History in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 4 hours on Polish country roads, closer to Warsaw than Krakow as Marta informed us, we happened upon the assuming small town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/1-enter-zwolen.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Enter Zwoleń" class="size-medium wp-image-531" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/1-enter-zwolen.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Enter Zwoleń&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we'd told Marta that at first we'd just want to walk around the town, and perhaps later go to the record office to see if we could glean any more information, Marta's keen inquisitiveness lead us directly to the town hall in search for records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/tesco-zwolen.tiff"&gt;&lt;img alt="Town Hall" class="size-medium wp-image-532" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/2-zwolen-new-city-hall.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Town Hall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With out speaking any Polish we would have been lost, but with Marta's hobbyist passion the Director of Records was happy to oblige us. In a stroke of great coincidence the local historian Pawel was in the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/2-zwolen-new-city-hall.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pawel, local Historian" class="size-full wp-image-504" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/3-pawel.jpg" style="width:133px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pawel, local Historian&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coincidence because Pawel was actually on Holiday, but since it was the last day to file taxes in Poland, he was milling about the beaureaucratic centre. Even more coincidental was that Pawel's pet subject was the pre-war Jewry in Zwoleń. He spoke no English but Marta was a keen and capable interpreter. In fact between Marta's desire to learn more of her country, and Pawel's joy at having someone with whom to share his reseach, the the two of them started to delve into great detail about Jewish history. Surprsingly the next 2 hours turned into a rich impromptu tour through time and space. Going down the rabbit hole, Pawel lead us to the town library. The building housed around 2,000 volumes, about as much as you could fit into the converted Pharmacy (Polish:"Apteka").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Library" class="size-medium wp-image-534" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/5-zwolen-library.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt; The Library&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we encountered the Librarian [Zbigniew]{style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; cursor: text; font-family: 'Segoe UI',Arial,clean,sans-serif,'Segoe UI Emoji','Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 17.93px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 21.92px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; word-wrap: break-word;"}. On Pawel's prompting, [Zbigniew]{style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; cursor: text; font-family: 'Segoe UI',Arial,clean,sans-serif,'Segoe UI Emoji','Segoe UI Symbol'; font-size: 17.93px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 21.92px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; word-wrap: break-word;"} immediately dug up a 1998 self-published, amateurishly-bound monograph &lt;strong&gt;O &lt;/strong&gt;[Ž]{style="font-family: Arial;"}&lt;strong&gt;ydach zwoleńskich i nie tylko,&lt;/strong&gt; about local Jewish history. In the back of the book was a transcription of the town register, containing a list of known Jewish inhabitants accurate as of 1929. Klajnbohm was not on the list in any spelling variation (such as "Kleinbaum" ) despite the plethora of Kupermans, Niselbaums, and Goldfarbs. Wajgman was listed however. A friend we knew through our U.S. Synagogue, we discovered shared Zwoleń ancestry with us. Today the are called Wegman. The register informed us on which street they lived on. With the Wajgmans found but the Klajnbohms not, my Grandfather grew disappointed. "The point of going to Zwoleń was to find clues to our forebears, and in this regard we were unsuccessful, despite strenuous efforts," he lamented later on our return. This leads my Grandfather to conclude that Solomon must have lied on his naturalization papers. In my search through the register I did notice a "Perlmutter, Szlomo", and his mother was a "Sarah Perel Klajnbohm". I favour this matronymic theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressing on, Pawel and Zigneb presented us with two more documents: a series of black and white photographs, and some historical newspapers. We noticed in one photograph of the interior of the old synagogue a scene of disarray. The state is unexplained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-synangoue-interior.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Is the interior state normal for the time?" class="size-medium wp-image-538" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-synangoue-interior.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Is the interior state normal for the time? Couch is torn, and object lying against walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic newspapers for our perusal chronicled quotidian life from 1700 to WWII. Flipping though one of the preserved reprints, my mind darted to one article that ended with a list of statistics, whose index column contained names. Waijgman was among them. Asking Marta to interpret this list, she explained that it was a record of which vehicles had been commandeered for the war effort. The Wajgman's had contributed there 1500kg capacity truck. My father says this makes sense as a Wajgman met a wife selling vegetables in Radoom, 20 kilometres away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/6-truck-requisition.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The transcriptions of historical newspapers." class="size-medium wp-image-507" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/6-truck-requisition.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The transcriptions of historical newspapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of statistics Pawel mentioned that pre-war there were 10,000 people in the town, being 51% Jewish. Today he claims there are only 9,000 with virtually no Jews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another curiosity found in these newspapers was a cover depicting a tree in the Jewish cemetery which remarkably resembled a menorah. The Jewish cemetery is estimated to have been around since 1500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After our we exhausted the literature we offered to take Pawel to lunch, but he countered by insistently inviting us on a walking tour. In our circuitous route, Pawel proved himself knowlegable. He pointed out the only 3 buildings in Zwoleń that has survived Nazi invasion and destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-pre-war-house-on-square.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="One of the pre-war buildings." class="size-medium wp-image-542" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-pre-war-house-on-square.jpg" style="width:294px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; One of the pre-war buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-pre-war-building.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="... and another." class="size-medium wp-image-541" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-pre-war-building.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ... and another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-synagogue-exterior.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="This was the synagogue exterior." class="size-medium wp-image-543" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-synagogue-exterior.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This was the synagogue exterior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to find "Synagogue street",  which is impossible since there is no consensus of its location. The difficulty lies in that the only information as to its site was the recording of it being 100m East of a landmark on the main road. The main road was relocated in 1940s reconstruction. Therefore there are two possible locations, but Pawel thinks it is likely the elder site. Next to the synagogue we know there was also a Mikve, but also this building left no appreciable remains to help determine the original locus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having finished our loop we drove to the cemetery approximately a half-kilometre outside the cite centre. Harrowingly, the cemetery was also where lined-up executions took place during war-time as Pawel told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-cemetary-as-it-was.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The cemetery as it was." class="size-medium wp-image-544" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/zwolen-cemetary-as-it-was.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The cemetery as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/8-zwolen-cemetary.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The cemetery today." class="size-medium wp-image-545" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2014/05/8-zwolen-cemetary.jpg" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The cemetery today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, since all the headstones were repurposed by Nazis into a stone walking path, which in turn was asphalted over during the Soviet era, there is just an unceremonious field. We walked the approximately 4 wooded acres which had a mound in the middle from a crumbled building. The tall treetops had become a sanctuary for local "murder of crows". Their squaking produced a not overbearing sound, but still strangely loud. The ground was littered with snails and many fallen-to-their-death fledgling crows. The menorah-tree, although the basic shape remained, was dying too. My father and Grandfather said a Kaddish for the bodies still underfoot. There wasn't anything left to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thanked Pawel who had to go back to his house to mow the lawn for his family. After a traditional Polish meal at a restaurant in a lodge outside of town, we drove the 4 hours back to Krakow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>The Need For Hacker Conference Yoga</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/the-need-for-hacker-conference-yoga.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-09T07:28:00-07:00</published><updated>2014-05-09T07:28:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2014-05-09:/the-need-for-hacker-conference-yoga.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Need For Hacker Conference Yoga&lt;/h2&gt;

That's when I thought I could solve the problem of haivng &lt;strong&gt;squeezing in&lt;/strong&gt; this not-on-the-schedule activity, by putting it on my schedule. And of course I could still ignore my own self directions, so inviting others to join me in doing Yoga holds me accountable and makes what could be a chore a bit more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We couldn't conduct a full yoga class, because of people aren't going to a Hackathon to do yoga. So putting on a design hat, what are the &lt;strong&gt;constraints&lt;/strong&gt; we're dealing with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constraints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I identified 5 main constaints on the typical western yoga lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suitable for &lt;strong&gt;total newbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 minute&lt;/strong&gt; time limit&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So it can fit in a lunch-break, and you can still eat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No yoga mat&lt;/strong&gt; required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be done in &lt;strong&gt;"work" clothes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So anyone can join on a spur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focuses on &lt;strong&gt;office-ache areas&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrists, necks, backs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is actually planned is a 16 part lesson, outlined and joyfully explained below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intro&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Talk about what yoga is:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postures, or shapes (Asana), breathing mediations, singing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good mindset:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition is unproductive - no comparisons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We all agree now to not judge anyone's abilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever a pose is difficult, make it a breathing exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm-ups&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neck circles&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Playing an arcade machines without coins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrist circles&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flossing for the forearms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cat/cow&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Featured in Gangnam style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Child's pose&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking pride in being lazy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knee plank&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real pirates kneel the plank.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downwards Dog&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga in one cryptic pose that you'll never perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forwards fold (Utanasana)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Touching your toes is easy, just bend your knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mountaing pose&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the slowest you can get up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving vertebra individually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long Utanasna&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding the timescale of Yoga:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if we do one pose for 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A first "flow"&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Lunge&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the starting gates of the 0 metre sprint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lizard&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The concept of surrender.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crescent moon&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your back also goes the other way believe it or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runners lunge&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first step to the splits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tree&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balancing as well as stretching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eagle arms, an optional bind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shoulder stand&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier than it looks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Winding down and Meditation&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laying down pigeon&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yoga can be done laying down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supine spinal twist&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jellies" says Boris Johnson.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corpse Pose&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "empty pose" for mathematicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

A decade later I perceived losing a friend to their dog obsession. With these strikes against dog-ownership, I became convinced that pet-ownership was immoral. However last month I took on 10 days of dogsitting to overcome my anti-dog prejudices. While the coordinates of my reality were not shattered, I did uncover an illuminating shared philosophical dilemma with canine-kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the core dog-care activities - feeding, petting, etc. - the most emotionally vital for the dog seemed to be "the walk". The walk is where I noticed the dog become most excitable, and express its greatest range of actions: exercise, forensics, socialising. On the other hand, the involvement of the walker is very flat, simply strolling a few city blocks. What is the purpose of this ritual? What is the human, doing, if just listening to podcasts as the dog has an on-rails experience, that is apparently so vital to it's psychic well-being? The answer is: being the &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meaning of the master can be seen when we view the dog in the master's absence. Our dog in question had 24-hour access to a back yard where it could run free, and interact with other animals. It occurred to me that it could do much of its walk activities, on its own, without me. Yet, pulling back the curtain in the home office I saw an empty yard, or maybe at most a lazy bowel relief. Why is it then that these crucial actions, for the dogs self-fulfilment can only occur, when I collar, chain, dominate and choke it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets us view the condition of the master, myself, but from a different perspective. To the dog, I am the master, but to my boss I am an employee; the education system I am student; to technological ochlocracy I am a source of income; to the government I am a cog. Through the lens of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Student_as_Nigger"&gt;certain books&lt;/a&gt;, I've come to see how much my conditioning has taught to work to please these authorities, and not much to please myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like the dog, I have many things which provide self enjoyment (if you're curious you can look at my public to-do list). Additionally I have the yard, all the resources that I need - the internet, public library and friends with which to learn and work. And somehow in the evenings or weekends when I'm left to myself, like the dog in the yard, I feel it very hard to start &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; for my own actualization. The same is not true, when I am being watched by my boss, or feel the need to impress an institution.  This scenario of the dog's of only being able to realise true fulfilment when leashed, is quite like the modern human condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one last vision with which I was left. It is the dog in the sunshine and grass, doing dog push-ups, inquisitively investigating an ant-hill, using a sticks and string to draw ellipses in the mud like an ancient Greek mathematician.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>2013: Numeric Year in Review</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/2013-numeric-year-in-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-28T23:32:00-08:00</published><updated>2013-12-28T23:32:00-08:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2013-12-28:/2013-numeric-year-in-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What were significant events or accomplishments in 2013?

Except the concept of such a cheesy introduction is spoiled by painful juvenile memories. The fact is you respect the intelligence of your collaborators inasmuch as you they can be asked open-ended questions - and you earnestly want to pry into their minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes facilitate weekly general meetings at the &lt;a href="https://sudoroom.org/"&gt;hackerspace sudoroom&lt;/a&gt;, where we have encountered the problem of making more than just cursory introductions, in a non-patronizing way. What follows is a list of some of the questions we have used to give people a chance to show their personality through their answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ranked in order of eccentricity,  from "what's your favourite so-and-so" all the way to the ultrawacky, and coupled with some background or historical answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Favourite screen saver from history?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What and when was your first mobile phone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the first thing you took apart? What did you first put pack together? And what's your life time percentage of [things taken apart]  / [things put back together]?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the future, what your favourite form of transportation? And which one do you snigger at in retrospect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your favourite word that has a difference in technical and nontechnical meanings. (And use it in a punny sentence)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E.g. Pixelated. Sprite. Logs. Mouse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is decreed that your computer will crash at exactly a the wrong time causing data loss, however you get to choose the word that you will be in the middle of typing as it happens. Which word do you choose, to bring a some of solace? And how far through typing do you want to be when it crashes?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspired because the week before the meeting &lt;em&gt;notes&lt;/em&gt; vandalized as someone was &lt;em&gt;typing&lt;/em&gt; the word "utilization" (they never got to finish).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What's the correlation between cat afterlife and human afterlife? (assuming cats have 9 times the canonical lives)?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mathematical points for &lt;em&gt;Aleph-1&lt;/em&gt;, and the realism of "Unknowable"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; avoid huge ships?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't have to follow the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Avoid_Huge_Ships"&gt;standard wisdom.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do (did) you use google reader [0,1]. Average the group score.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well tensions were high on this impending event. Some one dislike it so much they responded Not-a-Number. Maybe you can average something else of the group's,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you use as an alarm clock? And what are your snooze habits?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I.e. are you one of those multiple-alarm setters that doesn't trust the snooze?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give a hand signal.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need to have verbal answers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On your keychain, what is the ratio between keys and keyrings? What is the limit of another person's keychain, in which you can still potentially love them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In light of Swedish Cinemas displaying Bechdel Test ratings alongside Age ratings for movies - Imagine you are President of the World and/or Universe and asked to completely revamp the Movie Rating System. What do you do?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One suggested test was the binary of is this a "what is reality?" movie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A future-seeing machine comes to you in the form of a robotic, but well styled, humanoid interviewer (think Nardwuar) that broadcasts you online via an obscure and immemorable link. you are able to find out every detail of the future you would ever like to know because the interviewbot, if run for long enough, will eventually ask you to comment on all the future things you will do. So you can find out about the future, but not in the order you want, and it will always be unnerving and eerie. How long do you spend using the machine?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your friend comes to you and says that they have that type of mattress where the sheets are constantly falling off, and wants advice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a logic that states that showering "top to bottom" (i.e. soaping and rinsing the topmost parts of your body first) makes sense because dirty water will always run down your body [assuming you're standing up], so this will give you the optimal cleanse. You are thrust into public town-hall style debate (the townspeople look vaguely grubby) and asked to refute this logic to fend off the increasingly angry mob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagine a world in which drugs work backwards. that is rather than coming up and then coming down from a high, you first come down and then get the high (and then return to baseline). this also counts for drinking, you get the hangover first, and then later become drunk. is this world preferable to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slicing bread loaves in the classic way is outlawed. but each individual get the choice of which of the remaining two axes they can slice along for the rest of time - So it would be possible to slice across the long axis separating left and right, like a baguette, or in depth axis separating upper and lower, like a bagel. Understanding that this is an obnoxious rule, you are allow to impose one rule back on the government, whatever it is. Do you accept the trade?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how I structured the game, and how you could build from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game pieces consisted of 3 sizes of circles at 2.5cm 5cm and 8cm radii.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how I structured the game, and how you could build from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The game pieces consisted of 3 sizes of circles at 2.5cm 5cm and 8cm radii.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was experimenting with the right point attribution for each. As shown the point values are 1, 3, and 8 respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The maps were drawn by Anca Mosoiu of &lt;a href="http://techliminal.com/"&gt;TechLiminal&lt;/a&gt;, and included the standard square, the African continent, and a silhouette of a meditating Buddha (pictured).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rules:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants compete head-to-head,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and are given 30-seconds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to lay down non-overlapping circles,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;within the drawn boundary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competitor with the most points on the board at the end of the time wins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I tried to make the optimal strategy counter-intuitive which was to use the smallest pieces only. The ratio of points as I mentioned is: &lt;em&gt;1, 3, 8&lt;/em&gt;. If you calculate the ratio of area for each circle and normalize to the smallest circle you have ratios: &lt;em&gt;1, 4, 10.24&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we divide these ratios. we receive &lt;em&gt;1, .75, .78125&lt;/em&gt; which approximate the decreasing return that I wanted to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children were competitive with adults. One child whose age meant that he could not spell his own name, showed fantastic geometric reasoning and opted for the mostly 1's strategy. Yet surprisingly only one competitor realized that all-1's not only gave the best points per area, but were also the easiest to pack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Create a new set of circles in which whose points per area ratios are increasing rather than decreasing, and give contestants more time 1 minute perhaps? What would you change?&lt;/p&gt;

They are from Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography, that too-strong dose of propaganda that turned me off of the mystique of supposedly messianic  technology. (Perhaps I don't give enough weight to the fact that it was the first and last book that I read entirely on a laptop). I admit I was - and still am - wooed by the allure of technolust, but at that moment, I stopped seeing computational progress as a deliverance and started seeing it blunt tool, often overdressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically it was Bill Gate's quotes in this book that dislodged and set in motion the changing of paradigms. (Of course at this time, it still took a white man's voice to get me to hear it). Graciously, when asked what he thought about the iPad 2, Gates quipped “Here I am, merely saving the world from malaria and that sort of thing, and Steve is still coming up with amazing new products.” The bite of this sarcasm shattered the coordinates of my reality. We still have malaria to eradicate! A marketing  tech trends seems insignificant in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't have forseen it then, but 5 years later it's inevitable that this summer I am working at &lt;a href="http://dssg.uchicago.edu/"&gt;Data Science for Social Good (DSSG)&lt;/a&gt;, the "University of Chicago summer program to train aspiring data scientists to work on data mining, machine learning, big data, and data science projects with social impact." The fit is perfect, I am shoulder to shoulder with challenging colleagues who have as much penchant for the command line as desire to address human problems non-paternal ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically my team's charge these 12 weeks is to partner with &lt;a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/project/predicting-students-that-will-struggle-academically-by-third-grade/"&gt;Tulsa Public Schools to better predict which 3rd graders are likely not to pass reading proficiency tests&lt;/a&gt;. Armed with the school data of Oklahomans aged 4-9, the goal is to help struggling students as early as Kindergarten, by suggesting which programs will likely improve their reading the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps what's most impressive to me about the DSSG organization is their healthy skepticism and introspection. There are weekly required discussion sections around the ethics of data science. Here  The questions top of are in the vein of whether &lt;a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/sase_panel.htm"&gt;"approaching the world as a software problem is a category error that has led us into some terrible habits of mind?" and if "machine learning is like money laundering for bias."&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unresolved dilemma which I dealt with this week, was the way to handle student's grades as data in our prediction problem. I asked a colleague of mine who is working on another education project how she was treating grade data. The obvious thing to do, she responded, was GPA calculation, plus numeric counts of each letter earned. She was working at a High School level, but our early primary school students are so young that I take issue extracting meaning out of their academic "performance". This issue stems from the way that grades personally (dis)served me growing up. I felt that they were artificial switches I was meant to manipulate, completely disconnected with education.  In some way I don't want to reify the power of the grade algorithmically. On the other hand we want the most accurate models, to best help our students. I've decided to take a cue from the team &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/07/19/486499835/can-big-data-help-head-off-police-misconduct"&gt;working to identify police offers likely to have adverse incidents with the public&lt;/a&gt; who have chosen not to include race as an attribute in their model, and eschew GPA for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I'll acknowledge my privilege to be able to join a Gates-style tech-for-good crusade this summer.  I read more now into his 2011  Forbes interview: "The metric of success is lives saved, kids who aren’t crippled,” says Gates. “Which is slightly different than units sold, profits achieved. But it’s all very measurable, and you can set ambitious goals and see how you do.” The ambitious goals have been set at DSSG, now there are 5 weeks left to see how we do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Profiled by Wikimedia Sweden</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/profiled-by-wikimedia-sweden.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-20T21:14:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-20T21:14:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2012-08-20:/profiled-by-wikimedia-sweden.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haxpett"&gt;Axel Pettersson&lt;/a&gt; is a well-bearded Swede who feels equally at home at the stern of his clipper and editing Wikipedia from within the &lt;a href="http://wikimediasverige.wordpress.com/2012/06/08/renvarning-pa-stan/"&gt;arctic circle&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In my most recent involvement with self-appointed subculture, the Zorba Festival, the nerve centre of all Negev Desert chill-outs, I lost a similar battle but wouldn't know it until too late. The tent was in fact patchwork canvas over a geodesic dome, the time late, and the attendees personified bric-a-brac. After a half hour wispy and softly spoken crash course on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan" title="Koan"&gt;Koan&lt;/a&gt;s we were instructed to sit in partnered lines and ask the Koan-du-jour to each other. The style is must be explained is that for one hour in alternating 10 minute segments the answerer will ponder the Koan to their counterpart whose only job is to listen and stare into the orator's eyes. Skeptical, but still curious, and being in the initial position I spoke to the Koan "Who is in?" I started a dialectical journey on the distinction of in/out, and what or who was even qualified to be split into these categories. When the clava rang-out the indication to switch roles, I could not have prepared myself for what was to come. Following her silent and tranquil cross-legged listening of  my philosophy this Woman erupted with a voice-wrenching tirade scapegoating me for her eating-disorder. "Will you love me if I have half-and-half  in my Coffee?! Will you love me if I have linguine with the sour-cream?! The 30% sour-cream?! Will you LOVE me THEN?!" The outburst flourished into an inspection of all the personal details surrounding this difficulty, and posited that I may not love her if she didn't jog at the gym daily or indulged in various confections. Round two commenced, and wiping some spittle that was projected onto my cheeks from her raging mouth, I continued my calm discourse on what "in" meant for society or for one's personal life. On her second round of answering she leaned into my tensely unblinking eyes and shouted about the saga of her hips loud enough that the Zen master came to restrain the obviously very disgruntled, and probably very hungry woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem that I followed the Zen path more closely in this encounter, but that I see now is the view of the Zen amateur. This woman was using her refrigerator as a record player (she would have mentioned that would be ample room). "Will you love me then?!" was really was an inquiry like, "Do you hear this record in this fridge?" I thought I had to ignore her to make my point clear that fridges don't play records. But that only meant I never got to understand the sound of a fugue on a Frigidaire.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Paradox?</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/paradox.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-16T18:23:00-07:00</published><updated>2011-06-16T18:23:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2011-06-16:/paradox.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div&gt;
