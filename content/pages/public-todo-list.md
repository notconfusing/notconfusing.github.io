Status: draft

Inspired by [Teemu Leinonen](http://www2.uiah.fi/~tleinone/) I've decided to keep a public to do list.

In a daring and probably senseless effort to push my self here are the minutiae of my [Getting Things Done](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) workflow.

**Big Bits**

[Project - Projects](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/maxklein/31210892/). There is one meta-project in my life, to manage my active projects.

**Fiddly Bits**

All the lists to which I'll publicly admit to keeping.

-   [To Blog](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/maxklein/29560639/#section.tasks) At some point I thought these ideas would be clever enough to write about at some point.
-   [To Correspond](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/maxklein/30682473/#section.tasks) If you're waiting to hear from me, you can check this list.
-   [Someday Maybe](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/maxklein/30949540/#section.tasks) Minor things that I'd like to do when I have free time.
-   [Avocation](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/maxklein/36011504/) Everything that I do that's not really work.
-   [Misc Next Actions](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/home/maxklein/15024024/#section.tasks) I can't see why you'd be interested in this, but there you go.
