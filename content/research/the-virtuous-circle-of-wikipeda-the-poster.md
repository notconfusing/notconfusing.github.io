It may seem like a small piece of work, but I wanted to commemorate this moment - my first poster. I never had the need to manufacture one. Today I presented it at [NetSci](http://netsci2014.net/) (Network Science) 2014, and received many useful comments on the research. We found a few other that are, like ourselves, translating  the ['method of reflections'](http://notconfusing.com/method-of-reflections-explained-and-exampled-in-python/ "Method of Reflections: Explained and Exampled in Python") into new domains. The paper related to this poster is in review, but you can also access a [preprint files on github](https://github.com/notconfusing/wiki_econ_capability/tree/master/paper/cscw).

On the art side I'd like to thank [unluckylion](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE0OjDPmmHRJMfmSqWD1yRw), for encouraging me to make a bold statement. I think it paid off, and I'm only mildly guilty about the blatant copyvio of the Wikipedia logo. Although I'll use that point to show the necessity for the new [attribution logos](http://notconfusing.com/sneak-peek-at-wikimedias-new-bold-high-concept-iconography/ "Sneak Peek at Wikimedia’s New Bold, High Concept Iconography").
