I was listening to a din, but it wasn't the standard Beverly Hills engine symphony, it was my tinny headphones barking “isgodaman” by the Snivelling Shits, which, was equivalently abrasive . While I was striving to put a positive spin on the unavoidable opulence the poorly recorded vocalist was questioning “Does he drive a red Bugatti/ does he go for girls with a bite?/ Or does he have to jerk himself/ to sleep every night?” This inquiry took on significance partially because I had jerked myself to sleep last, but mainly because in the distance was Bryce, a model fop with a penchant for al dente women and expensive red cars.

Quite surprisingly I was recognized by this purposefully striding figure, and thought that I would be the benefactor of a “Hey, man!” delivered on the end of a pointing finger with diminishing volume as his momentum carried his path away from mine. But I got a handshake, and so I responded in kind with a buddy two-squeeze massage on the shoulder. We asked each other what we were doing. I was getting coffee, and I'm not sure if he believed me. He claimed to be getting some “R and R,” and I certainly didn't believe him. It seemed more likely that he was training for a speed-walking competition in the with-a-bluetooth-earpiece category. Acting as a human yellowpages he offered to show me some coffee shops.

 

“I still haven't caught up on my Jet-lag from India” he hurriedly small-talked “it's been two weeks.”

“They say it's an day per hour,” I offered.

“Well India's 14 hours difference,” he responded with rapid incredulity.

“Then the it all adds up,” I calmly verified.

 

At this point he was steering me down a side street. “I don't like to wait at the cross-walk,” he explained with the same constant impatience all our conversation had had up to this point. Yet the nervous gesture came off diluted seemingly having no further anxiety in which to extend.

 

My talk-to-elders training produced “so what where you doing in India?” Which was the impetus to a tirade of how amazing his meditation retreat was, how relaxed he became, and to what ancient Hindu philosophical secrets he is now the possessor. This brought us up to the front door of the coffee shop where the crucial test was sprung.

“How's my beard?” he stroked.

I flattered “take a quarter of an inch off the chin, but the moustache is looking great.”

“Great, see you later. Shalom.” he waved and jogged, ending halfway into the crosswalk. He was now heading in the magnetically opposite direction from the one I'd met him. Yet in some strange logic that only applied to Bryce, he was still going to some meeting which was equally as important as the one he'd diverted from to accompany me for 100 yards.

 

Reinstating the punk into my ears the Snivelling Shits we're concluding “Oooh save it for the papers/ 'cause I just don't want to know/ see I gave the old bastard his cards years ago.”
