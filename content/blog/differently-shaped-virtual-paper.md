The very first time I heard it I was immediately convinced by Killer Mike's un-festschrift "Reagan". It's a lucid, orchestrated, and damning exposé of what Reagan's legacy has meant for less privileged people in America  "\[...\] thanks to Reaganomics, prisons turned to profits  
Cause free labor is the cornerstone of US economics". However as much I appreciate what Killer Mike spits, and specifically how he's spitting it, I never felt I could fully connect with the message having never been directly effected by Reagan's policies - until now.

This week my [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](http://nsfgrfp.org/) application was "rejected without review." The reason given was my application was not conforming to the submission standards, I hadn't left 1 inch margins. It was true, I'd left 2cm margins (0.79 inches). It wasn't a conscious decision, it was just technology ruling my life. As I keep Ubuntu's language set to British English to avoid too many red underline squiggles in my life - Libre Office had defaulted to A4 papersize when I went to write my document.

Now the [A-series of paper sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#A_series), is a rather clever invention if you've not learned about it's geometry. Each A*(n)* size is derived by folding A*(n-1)* in half AND every A*(n)* has exactly the same ratio of height to width 1:√2. The math is elegant. Fold 1:√2 in half and get 1:(√2 / 2) . Simplify by multiplying both sides by √2, and get √_1: √_(√2 / 2) √2:(2/2) = √2:1. Ingenious.  8½" by 11" on the other hand is about [Ronald Reagans's domination and monocultural hegemony.](https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192919/http://www.afandpa.org/paper.aspx?id=511)

The point is that there are  subtle ways that technology decides our lives. Sometimes they are about automatic defaults in open source software; other times its about how bureaucratic rule, leads to governments codifying their cruel procedural-focus [into even worse websites](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/34-dmv-nation/). Learn from my mistakes say I to myself, and beware any future NSFGRFP applicants who operate outside the mainstream.
