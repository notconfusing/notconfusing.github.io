It's been traditional recently to hold [Wikipedia Loves Libraries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Loves_Libraries) events during [Open Access Week](www.openaccessweek.org/), and I fully support the practice. What's also been traditional in a way that I wanted to change was the *editathon *format for those events. After scrunching my mind to brainstorm new experimental ways of holding these trainings and celebrations, I came up with [**Open Access Wikipedia Challenge**](https://p2pu.org/en/groups/open-access-wikipedia-challenge/)**. **  The challenge is to embed media that was harvested from Open Access journals in Wikipedia, and I created a [special edition barnstar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Open_Access_Wikipedia_Challenge_Barnstar) for completing it. This challenge is totally friendly to newbies and librarians as it includes over 1 hour total of six screencast tutorial videos that explain every detail right from the account creation, to transclusion, and each module has waypoint challenges.

Happy Open Access Week and Good Luck on the Challenge,
