The librarian part of my mind has surfaced these musical gems for me to re-evaluate, now that I am mathematically deserving. On point 1 Momentum, I am entirely behind. On Distance (2) and Death (3) they are themes perhaps darker than I would like to delve today, but give lots to think about in the upcoming decade.





### 1. Momentum





> Used to think 30 years old then the end comes  
> Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum

### 2. Distance





> Now I'm pushing past 30. If I bow out as the years close in. Abandon my sound man and band and them. I'll give no blushing curtsey. To the proud shouts of close kin. I ground it into ground and then some friends . Just drop a dusty curtain on the loud crowd when the show end. And end the whole thing where no men found me.

### 3. Death





> And now a n\*\*\*\* 30, so I don't think they heard me  
> That the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed  
> Tears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest  
> The thoughts of no success got a n\*\*\*\* chasing death  
> Doing all these drugs, hope for ODâ€™ing next, Triple X
