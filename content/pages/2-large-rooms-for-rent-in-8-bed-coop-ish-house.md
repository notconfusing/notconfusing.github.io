This newly purchased 8 BR house is seeking 2 female roommates to join as the house is slowly being renovated.

 

Who we are:

Hannah – 26 – Training as a dermatologist, has interests in social planning.

Chloe – 25 – Filmmaker and style oriented, passionate about transformation though fashion.

Dan – 37 – Naval engineer, handy with the wrench when not motorbiking to his local Venezuela .

Max – 25 – Wikipedian, hacker, yogi, and mathematician.

 

We are looking to make a coop-esque atmosphere. Cooking dinner together is informal but frequent occurrence. We would like to create a food-share to scale our vegetarian purchases. The house has 2 kitchens, one is being remodeled. A living room. 3 garages. Basement workspace and onsite laundry with two dryers. There is also a small yard where we plan vertical bike parking and a small raised planter garden. We unfortunately can't have any pets due to allergie.

 

What we are looking for:

We are seeking female-identified housemates around our age range.

You would like to be part of our small community, with regards communal food and cleaning.

It's a plus if you wanted to do yoga with us, or join in our tennis matches.
