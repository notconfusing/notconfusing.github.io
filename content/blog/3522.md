We seek to have 0 unread messages, this is our goal.  
We sort our inbox by unread, and then by date.

GTD: There is my unread messages, my remember the milk task list, and my calendar.

Lists are the most tricky: the approach is to subscribe from two addresses: One receives the digest, and one gets the full emails. The digested version arrives normally. But the full version arrives as already being marked as read. This is because its a pain to reply to digests. Now you can read headlines, and see if you want to go back.

Unsubscribe from everything you can immediately.

2-minute rule.

If you can make it into a task that can go on GTD, that's also acceptable. This is you communications channel, don't mix it up with your to-do list. Then you will frustratingly be unavilable to communications.
