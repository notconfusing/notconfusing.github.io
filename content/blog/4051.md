Have you ever played the game called "ride a bicycle?" It is a conversion of a finite game into an infinite one -  under the worldview that life is partitioned into two kinds of games. They are most succintly defined by their participants by James Carse: "Finite players play within boundaries; infinite players play with boundaries."

 

1.  Normally.
2.  Without having to go anywhere
3.  Using your hands
4.  Closer to the earth.
5.  Painfully.
6.  With more than one person.
7.  Creatively in your own way.
