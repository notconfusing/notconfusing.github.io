Having experienced this psychological contortion myself, I was intrigued to explore it further. One particular topic which caught my attention in the middle of an early chapter that expounded on 3 “sub-types” (my term) of racism. This post is my own summary of and reaction to the chapter, done as an exercise to really dig into the subject. I hope it will entice you to &lt;a href="https://robindiangelo.com/publications/"&gt;read the source&lt;/a&gt;, and other scholars on the subject, Toni Morrison who recently passed is foregrounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiAngelo outlines three different ways that racism manifest: colorblind racism, cultural racism, and aversive racism. I was most intrigued by aversive racism, as I think it is the biggest trap that I am likely to fall into, but will quickly outline the others as well. Colorblind racism stems from the approach to racism where one tries not to see race, and thereby racism can certainly not exist. The many practitioners of this racism have created the perversion that it has become racist to acknowledge race, a mental cul-de-sac that does nothing to address the actual racism that exists in society. Cultural racism, on the other hand could be seen as a type of schizophrenia where we comfortably exhibit racism—but only “backstage,” in the company of white friends. In front of P.O.C. we might act blankly or feign an artificial tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aversive racism, as I learned, is a type of racism where races aren’t named, but signified using other words as proxies like “underprivileged” and “sketchy.” The use of doing this allows us to express racism, without having to thinking of ourselves as racist. DiAngelo’s examples given for this are in making a racial choices, like calling the choice to live in whiter neighborhood, “unfortunate but necessary for ‘good schools.’” Or how we may deny we have few cross racial relationships by proclaiming how diverse our community and workplace are. The last instance struck me, and I thought of a very San Francisco/East Bay version of this as feeling better by moving to Oakland where it is diverse, without legitimately having a more integrated interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiAngelo connects the concept to Toni Morrison's “race talk,” where racism can be enacted through conversation between white people alone. And that I found fascinating, how a chat between two people in absent of anything else, can reify racism at large. The discussions are composed of an “us” and “them” and such a split renders the "us" as innocent, and the them as "not  innocent".  Thus race talk can be a good platform for aversive racism because it can just as easily use tropes that aren't racially explicitly. (Vis-a-bis the us-versus-them mentality, I also particular enjoyed the chapter on how unhelpful the binary of racists=bad and non-racists=good is at interfering honest looks in the mirror for white people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading, I saw aversive racism as a product of somebody who has socially learned the impoliteness of straight-up racism (that is the “educated” part), but isn’t actively challenging the way racism manifest internally and externally. What’s more the ideology that can lead to talking or being aversively racist can get in the way of challenging our racist thoughts because they are designed to slip under our own racism radar through contortions of vocabulary. As DiAngelo points out "somebody who is open about their racism might be in a better position to inspect their views, than an educated aversive racist who speaks though a linguistic codebook.” Which I think helpfully dispels the notion that aversive racism is a light-version, or a step on the way to practicing racial awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to apply what I learned to my own life, I meditated on ways that I have in the past or currently show aversive racism. Upon close inspection I was shocked to discover aversive racism in a conundrum I often have on LinkedIn. I have not quite learned an etiquette of LinkedIn; specifically how and when to accept connection invitations from less known for university mates, former colleagues, or acquaintances. I had a method where I would not accept connections of people who were more than 1 degree apart. But I must admit the rule was bent or applied based on whether I thought the connect-requester could potentially be career-beneficial connection. When you have only a literal CV in front of you, all the standard racist potential of classic resumé studies are lurking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course having learned about aversive racism, does not prevent me for continuing to enact it. Awareness, as ever, must be the first step, and I feel an important responsibility after having read and learned about this trap of thinking. I am glad to discuss all these points with you, find me at \@notconfusing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essays"></category></entry><entry><title>Manifest Dismantling: An Intention to Practice</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/manifest-dismantling-an-intention-to-enact.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-06T22:59:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-07-06T22:59:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2019-07-06:/manifest-dismantling-an-intention-to-enact.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;All the books I have been reading recently have had extremely instructive titles.

&lt;p&gt;Odell's book takes on particular importance for me as it is based off an epiphany she had at the Oakland Rose Garden, a location dear to me as well. The local author, &lt;a href="http://jennyodell.com/satellite.html"&gt;visual artist&lt;/a&gt;, and Stanford lecturer, questions the effects of the &lt;em&gt;attention&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;economy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;logic of productivity&lt;/em&gt;, discussing how me might resist those forces. Her answers surprised me. She does not believe that technological interventions like app time-limits are the solution, but rather that it is our own individual responsibility to cultivate and place our attention autonomously. This free-thinking attitude makes more sense as you read on, visible in the way in which she embeds the attention conversation into the political one of acknowledging the detrimental history of white patriarchal America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a long excerpt, approximately the first 2 pages of the conclusion of "How To Do Nothing" in which Odell introduces the concept of "Manifest Dismantling" which I found so provocative that I wanted to take it with me to chew on it further. [Bolding and insertion of Images my own].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you become interested in the health of the place where you are, whether that’s cultural or biological or both, I have a warning: you will see more destruction than progress."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “The Round River: A Parable,” the conservationist Aldo Leopold writes: One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or &lt;strong&gt;he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I went on a walking tour of downtown Oakland led by my friend Liam O’Donoghue, an activist and historian who runs the popular podcast East Bay Yesterday. The tour had been a thank-you for those who had contributed to the production of his “Long Lost Oakland” map, which includes indigenous Ohlone burial sites, extinct species, now-gone historic buildings, and an ill-advised giant gas balloon that (sort of) took off from downtown in 1909. Introducing the tour next to the Jack London Tree, Liam reflected on what it meant for newcomers to be learning Oakland history even as so many of the people and institutions who made Oakland what it was in the first place were being pushed out. In a time when monoculture threatens not only biological ecosystems, but neighborhoods, culture, and discourse, the historian, too, is in a position to see “the marks of death in a community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the corner of Broadway and Thirteenth, Liam took a moment to read a statement by T. L. Simons, who created the art for the “Long Lost Oakland” map. Simons described the distinct mix of love and heartbreak he experienced while spending hundreds of hours illustrating the map by hand. &lt;strong&gt;The process required him to meditate on a series of obliterations: of the burial sites of the Ohlone people, of the mass transit Key System that was later replaced by highways, and of the shoreline of marshes and tidal estuaries now reshaped for the demands of the global economy.&lt;/strong&gt; “In short,” he writes, “&lt;strong&gt;the story of this city’s transformations has always been the story of human and ecological devastation&lt;/strong&gt;.” And yet his dedication came from something more than despair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have chosen to illustrate this map not as a horrific depiction of the catastrophes that define our common history, but as a reflection of the resilience and magic I see in the city around me. It is a reminder that no matter how bad things get, they are always changing. I want Long Lost Oakland to ground the viewer in the place where they stand and to spark the imagination of those who will struggle for a different kind of future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon’s attitude—one of sadness, fascination, and above all a wish to attend to the past in the name of the future—reminds me of another backward-gazing figure. In the midst of World War II, the German Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin wrote his famous interpretation of Paul Klee’s monoprint Angelus Novus, in which a somewhat abstract angel appears in the middle of a picture plane surrounded by dark smudges. In an essay called “On the Concept of History,” Benjamin wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Klee-angelus-novus.jpg/395px-Klee-angelus-novus.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Klee-angelus-novus.jpg/395px-Klee-angelus-novus.jpg" style="width:395px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Angelus Novus https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Klee-angelus-novus.jpg/395px-Klee-angelus-novus.jpg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Angel of History must look just so. His face is turned towards the past. Where we see the appearance of a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe, which unceasingly piles rubble on top of rubble and hurls it before his feet. &lt;strong&gt;He would like to pause for a moment so fair, to awaken the dead and to piece together what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise, it has caught itself up in his wings and is so strong that the Angel can no longer close them.&lt;/strong&gt; The storm drives him irresistibly into the future, to which his back is turned, while the rubble-heap before him grows sky-high. That which we call progress is this storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/American_Progress_%28John_Gast_painting%29.jpg/640px-American_Progress_%28John_Gast_painting%29.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/American_Progress_%28John_Gast_painting%29.jpg/640px-American_Progress_%28John_Gast_painting%29.jpg" style="width:640px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; American Progress https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/American_Progress_%28John_Gast_painting%29.jpg/640px-American_Progress_%28John_Gast_painting%29.jpg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image of an angel that wishes to forestall progress is all the more remarkable given how often progress itself is what gets deified. One example of this is from an 1872 painting called American Progress by John Gast, meant to illustrate the concept of Manifest Destiny. The painting shows an enormous blond woman in diaphanous white robes striding westward into an unruly, dark landscape, trailed by all the hallmarks of Western civilization. Cultural domination is inextricable from technological progress in this image. &lt;strong&gt;Reading left to right, we see fleeing Native Americans, bison, a growling bear, dark clouds,&lt;/strong&gt; and formidable mountains; those are followed closely by a covered wagon, farmers with domesticated animals, the pony express, the overland stage, railroad lines, ships, and bridges. The progress-deity herself holds a tome simply titled School Book and is in the middle of stringing up telegraph lines, bringing connection to the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a short analysis of the painting, the historian Martha A. Sandweiss writes that when she shows the image to her students, they imagine it to be some large and grandiose oil painting. In fact, she writes, it’s merely twelve and three-quarters by sixteen and three quarters inches. That’s because it was commissioned and produced as a foldout by George A. Crofutt, the publisher of a series of Western travel guides. In that sense, we can consider it an ad: buyers of the Crofutt guides stood not just to see new places but to see the unfolding of a kind of divine progress (certainly something not to be missed!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the preface to one of his guidebooks from a year after the painting was commissioned, I found &lt;strong&gt;Crofutt’s breathless description of “a country that only a few years ago was almost wholly unexplored and unknown to the white race”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But since the completion of the Pacific Railroad, it has been occupied by over half a million of the most adventurous, active, honest and progressive white people that the world can produce&lt;/strong&gt;—people that are building cities, towns and villages as though by magic; prospecting, discovering and developing the great treasure chambers of the continent; extending our grand system of railroads all over the country, like a vast net-work; or engaged in the cultivation of the inexhaustible soil, which is literally causing the wilderness to “blossom like the rose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we now know that the soil was exhaustible after all, and that “developing” actually meant quickly depleting—as in, every old-growth tree in Oakland except for Old Survivor. The phrase “as if by magic” is a chilling erasure of the waves of straight-up genocide that ravaged indigenous populations in the nineteenth century. &lt;strong&gt;Thinking about the Ohlone shell mounds and about how all of the extinct species on my “Long Lost Oakland” map disappeared in the nineteenth century, I can’t help but read the white-robed woman in the painting as the harbinger of the cultural and ecological destruction.&lt;/strong&gt; While the tiny beings below her run for their lives, she wears a strange and benevolent expression aimed not at them but at something else in the distance—the imagined target of progress. It’s only with her gaze fixed on this target that she can trample on hundreds of species and thousands of years’ worth of knowledge without ever breaking her pallid smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the opposite of Manifest Destiny? I think it would be something like the Angel of History. It’s a concept I call manifest dismantling.&lt;/strong&gt; I imagine another painting, one where Manifest Destiny is trailed not by trains and ships but by manifest dismantling, a dark-robed woman who is busy undoing all of the damage wrought by Manifest Destiny, cleaning up her mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter enticed me from the opening quote because I too care about a land (a forest on Mount Sutro) that's being cut down. I was struck to understand that that's the typical sate of land in our society. But it's also only normal because of the anthropological manifest-destiny ideology we live under. I like how Odell points out that the trampling of this nature comes from forces that are fixated elsewhere, in this case on the future. The antidote, she claims is a presence where one can one be undistracted enough to see the trampling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To encapsulate all this, Odell coins the term "manifest dismantling" which for me is an inspiring vision. As a white man and European immigrant in America, the legacy of manifest destiny—as much as I never planned or supported it—is still somehow my legacy. As such I have the most responsibility to disavow it now. And beyond disavowal, the work is to &lt;em&gt;dismantle&lt;/em&gt;, which is a rather odd action to practice, when our typical training is for &lt;em&gt;developing&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;creating. Can you imagine a "software dismantler"? (There is another chapter I deeply enjoyed in the book about the devaluing of maintenance work.)&lt;/em&gt; This is a difficult, if not alien, concept for me grasp and enact, which is part of the reason I think it's a profound conclusion to draw. And while it's not precisely clear how to dismantle the destiny-society as a whole, connecting with the local region more, and choosing to participate less in this attention-economy late-stage of capitalism can certainly be first steps. I look forward to meditating more on how to manifest dismantle more in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I highly recommend &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42771901-how-to-do-nothing"&gt;buying Jenny Odell's book&lt;/a&gt;. It has facilitated my best, most contemplative thinking of 2019 so far.&lt;/p&gt;

At a dinner party I was telling a physical therapist I had just met about my herniated disc. She replied "did you just turn 30?" I hadn't, I was only 29 at the time, but I amazed at the accuracy nonetheless. She told me herniated discs were a very common injury among specifically men of my age. It's a juncture in life when people typically reckless with their bodies are all of a sudden greeted with a mortal reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the pain that I was feeling and the obvious link that was placed in front of me, a level of self knowledge was immediately unlocked. I've always thrown myself around. When I was child I dove for balls in goal and on the basketball court. As a teenager I enjoyed Aikido for the amount I was thrown around. In my 20s I trained by lifting stones (probably not well) having watched too many 1980's World's Strongest Man competitions on youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year before the the fall I noticed that my body had started to catch up with me. I suffered back spasms a few times after an epic bike ride or going out dancing all night. And then I jumped off a 5 metre ledge while camping, thinking nothing of it, foolhardy, and didn't spring to my feet as expected. Normally I relied on youthful regeneration to make those things okay, but I in that moment I couldn't "walk off" what turned out to be a herniated disc L5-S1 disc. While my body's resilience was lessening, my approach hadn't changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 years later, I'm grappling with the necessary adjustments. I know at minimum that the future for me is a time to warm up properly, a time to know my limits, and a time to say "no" to corporeal adventure occasionally. I have a body, and my body has changing abilities. I was lucky enough to have abilities in my past that allowed leap and crash and haul through anything. Now I see that's a type of privilege I took for granted. In the year after that ledge-jump that I was scarcely able to sit pain-free and was given the humbling opportunity to meditate on what life I could make if I was never able sit comfortably again. I'm lucky it turned out to be only a hypothetical question. And I'm lucky because it introduced me to ableism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a white man in the world it is more difficult for me to see many systemic inequalities, such as racism and patriarchy. I am also a "healthy" white man, and the fact that we don't usually add that qualifier serves the point that being in good somatic condition is under appreciated. Let me be clear, there are degrees, I still walk and live an active life. Yet my injury revealed that I hadn't felt the dimension of ability as a place where systemic inequality could exist. When you are part of the dominant group in any system of oppression you are at a disadvantage for seeing that system clearly. It's difficult to arrive at a clear picture through logic and discourse. Empirical experience on the other hand is quite the crash course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My introduction to ableism involved the disconnect from my friends by not being able to meet them in restaurant for dinner where sitting was expected. I hadn't noticed that offices and the public sphere assume the ability of not needing a place to rest. I'm certainly not the worst off, but my herniated disc and its trials lifted a veil for me. By extension I can see many of the healths I have now—as grand as sight, and as invisible as being migraine free—are likewise privileges. They are privileges like any other of a complex dynamic where self-awareness is only the first step, and lifelong anti-bias work of always remains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are suffering from a herniated disc, then I hope you too can understand what the meaning of the injury is for you. For me learning about my personality, and yet another of my prejudicial blindspots were important resultant lessons. If you would like to read more of my lessons from herniated discs I discuss &lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/5-lessons-learned-from-3-months-of-healing-a-herniated-disc/"&gt;5 initial ones here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/4-more-lessons-learned-from-2-years-of-healing-a-herniated-disc/"&gt;4 more subsurface ones here&lt;/a&gt;.  Please let me know what you reaction &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/notconfusing"&gt;on twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Its slick futuristic form with neon yellow striping gives the visual indication that it will &lt;em&gt;instantly&lt;/em&gt; dry your hands, which it doesn't. It takes 12 seconds. Still, I claim this represents a revolution. The watch-a-microwave-tick-down waiting time is a small price to pay for leaving the tiled room with hands truly free of water, rather than the &lt;em&gt;less-wet&lt;/em&gt; state my whole life prior to this invention taught me was normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Dyson_Airblade_Transparent_BG.png/512px-Dyson_Airblade_Transparent_BG.png" style="width:270px !important"&gt; The Dyson Airblade. Attribution: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dyson_Airblade_Transparent_BG.png&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand why the Airblade represents such a leap forward in hand-drying technology, we have to understand the past that Dyson was trying to escape. My earliest adventures in cognizant demoisturising were at my primary school, as a beanling that still hadn't mastered the use of a fly. At that time the state of the art was the rotating towel. This was a wall-mounted box from which hung a loop of cloth towel. You would use the towel loop as normal, and when it became too wet to be effective at all, you could pull on, and advance the towel to an unused portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is when I first came to suspect "drying your hands" was a bit of a misnomer. The towels in use with this looper were of such low quality that they bordered on plastic. This meant that absorption was low, and the inflexibility of the material could not easily journey through the intra-finger crevices. Thus, being commanded to dry my hands by my teachers was a tough lesson in delivering an impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because we were living in those dark-(read: wet)-ages, we couldn't perceive the problem, let alone the solution. I suppose the impetus to move off the technology was spurred by germophobic objections. Perhaps I am only using the term &lt;em&gt;germophobes&lt;/em&gt; because I did grow up as a hardened looped-rag wiper. For in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#Efforts_to_reduce_childbed_fever"&gt;Ignaz Semmelweis&lt;/a&gt; vein of antiseptic precaution - who reduced mortality rates for delivering mothers from 18% to 2% - we had yet to see the linkage between disease and this a bacteria conveyor belt. Yet, in retrospect I have have nostalgic pining for this conglomeration of metal and linen, for its speed and environmental sustainability, two measures it scores well on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ouroboric fabric was much better than it's successor - hot blown air. HBA fails miserably because of the temporal consideration. Only when I have wanted to see if, given enough time would the technique eventually desiccate my hand, have I not given up the loud nuisance. Throughout my adolescent years, my hygiene routine in restaurants, petrol and train stations, consisted of washing, and then slapping those large buttons with my elbow. This activated a machine that drew electricity from the grid and deafened me, but didn't dry for shit. I left a trail of drips on my way to the door as I wiped my hands on my trousers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testament to its failure, blown air is disappearing from the consumer landscape. A few last ditch efforts have been made to modernize the heated jet streams with the bolting-on of proximity sensors, but I think public can tell that this is just flash without substance. Hot air is just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, a third option has tried to merge the relative usefulness of elliptic towels, with a de-communalized nature: paper towels. Paper towels work, there is no doubt, but their down fall is the degree of ignorance with which they force you live. I worked in a dot-com office park on a bland 5th floor, whose corporate toilets' only pizazz were the luxurious 2-ply paper towels. The waste generated by paper towels is enormous mostly because of unused proportion of towel. If you look in a bin where paper towels are tossed off you will see that for any given towel less than 50% of it is actually damp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at that office I attempted to cultivate a technique which would maximize per-sheet usage. With enough care I found that 1 can be sufficient, there is a lot of fibre at your disposal that simply takes patience to utilize. While this might seem partly a way forward, the real issues here are cultural and educational. I received the same level of frustration that I might with someone sitting on a public transport blocking an open seat, when I would I stand at the mirror carefully detailing my hands and some ignorant fellow would waltz in and take 3 massive, unconscious pulls at the pulped-goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketers of paper towel, trying to childishly to save themselves from obsolescence have thrown in the red-herring of compostability. Naturally this just incentivizes waste all the more. The cleverest approach I've noticed to mitigating the ketchup-packets at McD's mindset was a sticker on a paper towel dispenser in hippie-haven Shasta, California. It said "These come from trees. This sticker saves 1,000 towels per year." The appeal to fulfil this prophecy was strong, and I hope many take up the cause.  Still we have only a small bandage on our aquatic crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lateral thinking approaches to navigate around the drying dilemma involve not getting wet in the first place. Another wasteful, non-renewable way, is the anti-bacterial gel method. We encounter this in the Western world when running water is not available, and for me personally is highly associated with Burning Man. I don't dislike this technique because you do save on water and drying. But we have been warned about the future danger of antibiotic-resistant super germs if our hubris in this technique grows too large. I can't live with that kind of responsibility on my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcogel's no-dry logic can be twisted even further. A friend of mine Sergey once tweeted that he felt guilty &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; washing his hands, if he didn't dirty them while in the bathroom. That makes sense, perhaps the most environmental way to dry your hands is to reduce the necessity of washing them at all. With the introduction of the proximity sensor to porcelain wares - in contrast to proximity sensing air-blowers - a washless sojourn can be imagined. The automatic urinal has came around within my lifetime, and I've welcomed it's ubiquity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential downfall of this philosophy is that it is difficult to monitor exactly how unused our phalanges are after a romp in the water closet. It's an unnecessary tight-rope to walk. During the writing of this essay, I was conducting a Sergey-inspired relief break when upon exit, I was confronted on my bypass of the sink and its subsequent chain reaction of interventions. This seemed like the perfect time to explain a marvellous new worldview to a interested audience. But the conversation turned heated when we failed to connect on what was metaphysically important in that public/private realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily we don't need to argue any more: all these trials have culminated into an end-point, the Dyson Airblade is it.&lt;br&gt;
The device floors me with its innovation: hygienic, efficacious, and environmental. It's usage requires no touching, so there is no viral by-proxy human contact. The sheer force of the air, because of it's shape, does actually work as if a squeegee. Let us pause on this point, Dyson has made what amounts to hologrammed rubber, and this is superior as a matter of mechanical principle. Despite that it uses electricity to operate, it has no by products like paper, and so allows for relatively clear conscience in patronage, especially in conjunction with renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dysonator does actually have it's weak point: education on how to use it is almost a government secret. You are mostly encountering it in airports where acquiring skills isn't top of mind. The instructions, if you notice them, are imprinted on its frame. They are a 2 point list. (1) To manoeuvre your hands into position to start, and (2) to shift them in the vertical plane. DONE. For the on-demand smartphone generation, though, these 2 steps are possibly one to many. (Remember the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uXJlX50Lj8"&gt;iMac advert with no step three&lt;/a&gt;? We're a generation past that.) The second, which requires 12 seconds of slow moving tai-chi, was a paradigm shift for my twitter addled brain, which I'm thankful for miraculously discovering.  Now meditation is unlocking an arid world of pleasure for myself and my extremities.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essays"></category></entry><entry><title>The Universal Empathy Machine: Nonviolent Communication Explained with Mathematics and Computer Science</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/universal-empathy-machine.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-28T06:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-07-28T06:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2015-07-28:/universal-empathy-machine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;0.

&lt;p&gt;Empathy is not sympathy. What's the difference? Think of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine"&gt;Universal Turing Machine&lt;/a&gt;. It is a machine that accepts a program and data, and runs that program on that data. In this way it can simulate all programs on all data. Let us think of a human as a program and human experience as data. &lt;strong&gt;Sympathy then, is running your program on someone else's data. Empathy is running their program on their data.&lt;/strong&gt; As you can see the results of the sympathy and empathy computations are not guaranteed to be identical. In a nutshell Nonviolent Communication is about becoming the Universal Empathy Machine, to be able to emulate the architecture of an arbitrary person given an arbitrary experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2015/04/nvc_cover.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cover of Nonviolent Communication, replete with sunflower" class="size-full wp-image-3755" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2015/04/nvc_cover.png" style="width:173px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cover of Nonviolent Communication, replete with sunflower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nonviolent Communication (&lt;/em&gt;abbrv'd &lt;em&gt;NVC)&lt;/em&gt;, is a theory by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg" title="Marshall Rosenberg"&gt;Marshall Rosenberg&lt;/a&gt; and the title of a book which has an unfortunate cover. Dressed up in a sunflower, you would associate it with self-help pseudoscience and may not allow it to surprise you. I only popped it open because &lt;em&gt;a)&lt;/em&gt; it could be pirated on The Pirate Bay, and &lt;em&gt;b)&lt;/em&gt; it was the reciprocating recommendation to me after I had been proselytizing my then-favourite-read to a friend, and so I felt obliged. As you can see neither of those reasons should really have you running to the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its insight-olives are sparse in its ciabatta. But however rare they are, those morsel were escape plans for decade-long arguments. I felt so resourceful having a theory of dealing with conflict where I never had one before. The only problem was I couldn't chat to my friends about it, let alone recommend it. (Update: which now turns out to be &lt;a href="http://2013.dareconf.com/videos/sauer"&gt;a common phenomenon&lt;/a&gt;). It's not intended for anyone that would use the terms &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;or reasonable&lt;/em&gt; to describe themselves&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; They'd be seeking different analogies, examples, and want it to be quite a bit shorter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well this is that version, your very short introduction to Nonviolent Communication, abridged and explained through mathematics and computer science analogies. I'll translate it into the realm of motivations, axioms, communication protocols, and finally foundational flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The Intention of Nonviolent Communication is Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any good sceptic should immediately be asking the purpose-question. What we are interested in is the family of problems characterized by the set of disharmonies, disagreements, and arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it must be noted that nonviolent communication admits to there being intractable arguments. Not every argument is solvable, and &lt;strong&gt;like the halting problem, there is no way of deciding whether an argument will run forever&lt;/strong&gt; without just trying to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main approach we use to arguments is &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;connections.&lt;/em&gt; A connection is relation \$latex aRb\$ between persons \$latex a\$ and \$latex b\$, not necessarily distinct, such that \$latex a\$ and \$latex b\$ are ready to resolve the disagreement. (What is it when one person is not ready to resolve? We address that later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argument resolution often never starts because it does not aim to find connection. In some cases we are talking past each other, we need to connect onto what the main topics are. In other cases we are discussing the same topic, but cannot connect onto a mutually agreeable answer, here NVC says to connect on observations and feelings and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protip: Notice connection is not always with "others", because often we want to change abusive self-dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Axioms of Nonviolent communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three strong axioms; sorry Wittgenstein fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.1 Feelings Are Connected to Needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We suppose a &lt;em&gt;Connection&lt;/em&gt; map, which maps feelings to needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\$latex C \colon F \mapsto N\$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where \$latex F\$ is the set of all feelings, and \$latex N\$ is the set of all needs. Note that \$latex C\$ is not necessarily injective but is surjective. The intuition here is that whatever feelings are observed, can be map to a need - probably unmet. This need usually becomes our focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.2 All Needs Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The set of needs and important needs are exactly equal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\$latex \forall n \colon n \in \{ \text{needs} \} \iff n \in \{ \text{imporant needs} \}\$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking as an axiom that all needs are important needs allows participants to declare needs without fear. The Universal Empathy Machine is a system of how to accept needs as important which do not appear important, &lt;em&gt;to you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2.3 There Is Always a Choice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empty set is not contained in the set of all choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\$latex S := \{ s \in \mathcal{P}(choices) \wedge s \neq \emptyset \}\$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's consider this our "Axiom of Choice" - we always have one. NVC asks us to accept a strong theory of free will. We have a nonempty, and possibly infinite set of reactions for all interpersonal interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Communication Protocols&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In trying to connect we will have to in some way communicate with each other, let's call this &lt;em&gt;messaging&lt;/em&gt;. NVC says that it's important to do this in a specific way. The messages that we pass between objects, probably humans, not necessarily distinct, are a 4-tuple containing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\$latex messaging tuple := (observations, feelings, needs, requests)\$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quadruple through the unveiling of each element, produces a flow from empiricism, to emotion, humanism, and finally to action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every message needs to contain all four parts, for brevity often they can be omitted. When starting though it can be useful to be exhaustive for practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.1 Observations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;Observing without Evaluation&amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;~ NVC Chapter Title 3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the canonical specification of Nonviolent Communication, this chapter is literally titled "Observing without Evaluation". Little do they know just how apt that is. In this messaging block we are transmitting our observations rather than our opinions. The assumption NVC operates with is that when viewing the world, we sense our observable universe and then evaluate it to return opinions. But it is not clear that those opinions are useful yet, so let's not naturally default to &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;evaluation&lt;/em&gt;. (Well you may not, depending on how much of a functional purist you are.) Taking a cue from the &lt;em&gt;lazy evaluation&lt;/em&gt; model, we don't have to return opinions until they are necessary. In fact, evaluation is not necessary until we send &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not a fan of fixed evaluation strategies, another way to think about the observation section is it's where we make our &lt;em&gt;imports&lt;/em&gt;. Here we are providing the populated namespaces, libraries, &lt;em&gt;Connection&lt;/em&gt; API and constants that we will reference in the rest in the rest of our communication. The context. Since sensory perception varies from human to human, we cannot rely on the exterior universe to be observed equally, thus we pass along our context. The point is that we do not want any of our further statements to be received ambiguously, so our definitions must be precise. We make only natural-philosophy-style remarks that equate to be exactly true. "You're always late," has truth value in the open interval \$latex (0,1)\$ depending on which human is observing. "We agreed to meet at 7:30, and I saw you arrive on Monday at 7:45, and on Tuesday at 8:05" has a truth value of just \$latex 1\$. Now the rest of our program, or proof - whichever side of the isomorphism you prefer - can refer to lateness with no misgivings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exercises: Observation or Opinion?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. "Your email signature is 41 lines long, rendering for me as over 4 screenfuls, where as your last 5 messages to the list were each less than 41 lines long."&lt;br&gt;
2. "Dante often does not wash his dishes in the hackerspace."&lt;br&gt;
3. "Allesandra told me that I was not good at identifying contrapositives."&lt;br&gt;
4. "Our group facilitator controls the meetings."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Answers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. This is an observation, which is entirely verifiable.&lt;br&gt;
2. This is an opinion because "often" is not defined.&lt;br&gt;
3. This is an observation if Allesandra literally said so, but not if Allesandra was only referring to a specific time the speaker &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task"&gt;did not identify a contrapositive&lt;/a&gt;, in that case the speaker would be making an evaluation.&lt;br&gt;
4. This is an opinion because "controls" is open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protip: when you are having difficulty finding observations to base what you want to say, and your communication is a reply it is OK, and even encouraged to literally repeat what your partners have said. \$echo what-they-said. More about this in &lt;strong&gt;4. Receiving&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.2 Feelings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;There is the counter-intuitive Rosenberg law: &amp;quot;Expressing our vulnerabilities can help resolve conflict.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After having carefully preserved the pre-evaluation &lt;em&gt;observation&lt;/em&gt;, it is finally time to also give the results of our evaluations - &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt;. To explain what feelings are we explore a classic gotcha - &lt;em&gt;psuedofeelings.&lt;/em&gt; Pseudofeelings unfortunately do pass duck-typing tests. They key difference, is that, with respect to the feeler, feelings are internal, and psuedofeelings are external.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of pseudofeelings are "I feel unimportant", "I feel misunderstood", or "I feel ignored". Re-expressed as feelings these would be, respectively: "I feel discouraged because I observed I was not part of [important decision]". "I feel anxious because you doing [action] doesn't reflect that you understood me.", "I feel hurt, because I perceive I am being ignored.". These re-expressions take an external feeling, and talks about what external event made you feel internally. This is important, because a statement about yourself can never be blaming, and allows others to see your perspective on your observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exercises: Feeling or Pseudofeeling?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. "I feel scared when you talk about about forking".&lt;br&gt;
2. "When you don't cite me, I feel neglected."&lt;br&gt;
3. "I'm happy that you found time to come to Wikimania."&lt;br&gt;
4. "I feel disappointed by the fact that you did not publish your dataset, because I had to recreate it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Answers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Feeling. Scared describe's the internal state of the feeler.&lt;br&gt;
2. Pseudo-feeling. Neglect is a thought about the exterior world. Feeler is probably &lt;em&gt;depressed&lt;/em&gt; about not having their work recognized.&lt;br&gt;
3. Feeling. The user happy, and said so.&lt;br&gt;
4. Pseudo-feeling. Despite very clear reasoning, disappointment is not a feeling, but a pseudofeeling. User is probably feeling aggrevated because of needless extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.3 Needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;God gave us the universal needs, man created the rest&amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;~Einstein&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have described the outside world, and stated how we feel about it, but we'll require one more step to expose our "&lt;em&gt;Connection&lt;/em&gt; API". &lt;strong&gt;Needs are those sufficient and necesarry condition for you life.&lt;/strong&gt; According to NVC all humans come preloaded with immutable natural feelings which are factory defaults. Because needs are very low-level, primitive objects, it s likely that the communicators will have some of these in common. And with common needs, connection can be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needs are typically very basic, like: autonomy, celebration, creativity, appreciation, love, respect, play, peace, food, rest, sex. Communicating these needs may seem weak, irrational, and impossible to admit out loud, but the whole point is to open up. &lt;strong&gt;This point is opensourcing ourselves to the very lowest machine-level.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two ways in which this Richard Stallman doctrine aids us with emotion. First, the open code of ourselves is a signal for our partners to work with us, and the mystery of how we work disappears. Secondly, when we disclose our code, all bugs are shallow. It is scary that others will be delving into our innermost code, but like Heartbleed, it is the only route to long term security. Remember&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; in order to further our opening have the &lt;strong&gt;Axiom 2.2&lt;/strong&gt;, the safety mechanism that all needs are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exercises: When Are Needs Being Expressed?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I feel angry when you talk about transhumanists that way, because I am wanting respect for my own destiny and I hear your words as an insult.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I’m discouraged because I would have liked to have progressed further in my work by now.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I feel disappointed because you assigned yourself to those bugs, but didn't squash them.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I’m sad that you won’t be meeting me at the vegan restaurant for dinner because I was hoping we could chat about anarchism together.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Answers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanting respect for way of life is a basic need, whatever it may be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is close enough to a need. It is implied that the need to is for the speaker to be feel fulfilment from progressing through work. This is actually an exercise verbatim out of the original NVC book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need is being expressed here. Perhaps the speaker needs the mental comfort of having no outstanding issues, or needs the security of that comes with trustworthy friends - we don't know and it isn't clear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human contact is a need. Maybe they also need a tempeh gyro.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3.4 Requests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;Callbackhell.com&amp;#39;s author Max Ogden analogizes callbacks to the numbers given you at restaurants that tell waitrons what to do with your food after it has been cooked. In our case, it is more like the waitron telling you that their job has many harsh realities, which makes them feel very oppressed, crushing their need for economic freedom, and finally telling you to help them smash the capitalist wage-labour sociopolitical complex.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At last we can try to alter the world with requests. Requests are callbacks we send to our communicating partner. They indicate what and when we'd like your partner to do. Like asynchronous javascript, there are a lot of security issues. Co-communicators won't want to run to malware. That's why the best request-callbacks are verified non-malicious by being the conclusion of a observation-feeling-needs-request syllogism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protip: By &lt;strong&gt;Axiom 2.3&lt;/strong&gt; we always have a choice, and so it is impossible to be in a situation where only the other party can break a stalemate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuing precise requests clarifies what we want from our partner. If it feels difficult to articulate what we want from others, that's typically because it is not an action. NVC says that more specific actions make better requests, otherwise we're issuing request that the receiver can't know if they've done it. If we shout at our colleague that a project is behind schedule, and we know they can't speed it up - we're not asking them to speed it up, but merely to acknowledge our anger. In this case the call back request might be "give receipt of my frustration". Colloquially this would be known as venting. It is nice to have no ambiguity about when the roles are just to listen, or to actually address a behavioural pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exercises: Request or No Request:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I want you to grok me.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I'd like for you to indicate one moment in my presentation that you appreciated.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I would like you to walk more slowly in the airport and tell me where you're going before you walk off.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“I want you to be proud of your organizing work.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Answers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a request, because grok is not specific action. It could however be illustrated by asking for the receiver to paraphrase speaker. (See how to do this well in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Receiving&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This request is asking for a something concrete, empathetic reception. These kinds of requests are made to seem ridiculous in the modern era, but that is just the long term cultural effect of "&lt;a href="http://www.thewire.com/national/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/19730/"&gt;guess culture&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A little bit exasperated, but quite clear actioning in the request. This isn't not not one of my pet peeves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is the speaker going to know when the receiver is being proud? "I want you to tell my friends about your organizing work," is more direct if that's what they're looking for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Receiving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVC's messaging protocol is two-way, and now that we've covered &lt;em&gt;"expressing honestly"&lt;/em&gt; there's still &lt;em&gt;"receiving empathetically"&lt;/em&gt;. Receiving empathetically can be understood as the process of parsing unstructured conversation text into the formal grammar of NVC. The conversation text is what the other person is telling you and our target grammar is the observation-feelings-needs-request 4-tuple. We are not guaranteed to get all of the components, and not in any specific order. We've just got a really difficult parsing problem on our hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that people are offended when they are asked, "Did you hear me? What did I say?" is because it s actually difficult to paraphrase what may already be a hard message to hear. We will attempt to do better, to translate their communication into an NVC object. Once we can be sure we have their experience (data), and how they are dealing with that experience (program), we can become the Univeral Empathy Machine (&lt;strong&gt;section 0&lt;/strong&gt;), and be fully empathetic. When done right the empathetic affect will come alive. Firstly, and very clearly their need to be just-listened-to will be fulfilled. More subtly, our partners can fine-tune their thinking &lt;em&gt;by seeing how closely our Empathy Machine mirrors their Identity function.&lt;/em&gt;  That is, how well our reflection matches their intended expression. This lets them know if we are missing any of their points, or they haven't stressed what they would like to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protip: Even if someone starts trying to brute force attack us with volume and vitriol, we can still receive empathetically. Intimidating messages are also people asking us to meet their needs. Try for instance, "It seems like you're really angry about my deleting the private key; because you need more security about what's happening in your life." Likewise, if we are engaged with someone not ready to resolve, see if an application of empathy towards them helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counter-intuitively this paraphrasing saves time, even though it takes time. A typical pitfall in a time-saving mentality of receiving is the bad habit of trying to short circuit the conversation by offering unsolicited advice to people. Offering unsolicited advice would be as if a parser (a) took input, (b) maybe did or didn't parse the input, (c) did not verify the meaning of the maybe-parsed result, and then (d) returned advice based on exogenous heuristics. Returning that computation to the speaker would understandably be nonplussing if not absolutely frustrating as it is devoid of any indication that it related to what they said. Giving advice is only useful &lt;em&gt;iff&lt;/em&gt; advice is what the speaker is asking for. By assuming they want a “fix-it” response, we are only engaging in the folly of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansplaining"&gt;mansplaining&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receiving empathetically is to parse our partners messages and run it through our Universal Empathy Machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exercises: Empathetic Reception (Y/N)?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person A&lt;/strong&gt;: Counting error in Ultimate Street Fighter IV finals? How could I do something so stupid? &lt;strong&gt;Person B&lt;/strong&gt;: Nobody's perfect, don't be too hard on yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person A&lt;/strong&gt;: You're a delusional utopian.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Person B&lt;/strong&gt;: Are you feeling frustrated because you would like me to admit that there could be other ways of interpreting the Black Lives Matter movement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person A&lt;/strong&gt;: Oh I’m being SO BAD! I NEVER eat cupcakes! &lt;strong&gt;Person B&lt;/strong&gt;: Maybe exercising more would help you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person A&lt;/strong&gt;: When friends of a friend of a friend join our camp without showing commitment, I feel encroached on. It's like how fraccing companies squeeze me with anti-protest tactics. &lt;strong&gt;Person B&lt;/strong&gt;: I know how you feel. I used to feel that way too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person A&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m unhappy with the grant's status because you should have made more impact by now. &lt;strong&gt;Person B&lt;/strong&gt;: I know you're unhappy, but we've been slowed by bureaucratic process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Answers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B is giving advice to A, which is not an empathetic response. "You sound like you're enraged by your lapse of concentration," is more along the NVC lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empathetic response since B is trying to ascertain from A's perspective why A might be lashing out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again B is advising A, even though the tone is lighter. B might want to try and understand what feelings are behind A's &lt;a href="http://queerfatfemme.com/2015/06/25/neutral-about-food/"&gt;not being neutral about food&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not an empathetic response, an sympathetic response. Same data, but whose program is being applied?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trick empathy. Just saying you understand is not the same as demonstrating you understand. B left A's comment about impact on the floor, which B could have used to empathise with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Criticisms of NVC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many different input methods can we use to write an email? Maybe with a physical keyboard, or virtual one on a phone, &lt;a href="http://sangaline.com/blog/optimizing_for_swype/"&gt;different auto-complete&lt;/a&gt; schemes, speech-to-text, and maybe we've even had the pleasure of tapping one out T9 stylee. Even though we may aim to transcribe the same thoughts, based on the technique used, the final text will be different. If the text of our emails are altered so too are the conversations. Now, different formats of email it will benefit specific ways of writing. We might be happy arranging dinner plans tapping on glass, but for conforming to the standards of a formal letter begs for the old clickety clack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As input methods change a conversation, so does NVC. Since it is very literally a theory of discourse, using NVC will necessarily bring with it &lt;em&gt;prediscursive&lt;/em&gt; bias. The format of the discussion is not variable that is discussed. But fair enough, any communication strategy would come attached with its own biases. The question then really becomes, &lt;em&gt;since NVC is prescribed conversation format, which speakers does it benefit&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVC's founding theorist, was an American white man born in 1930 as the son of Russian Jews. What does that mean specifically for who NVC benefits in conversation? My reading turned up no mention of how Rosenberg's personal background might affect his theorizing. In my opinion - I am myself a white man with similar citizenry and ancestry - it imports notions of classical logic, a Mazlowic need hiearchy, and western rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To expand, the technique has an orderly system to follow. This system is static and procedural, where it could be more goal-directed. The ontology presupposes the universality of basic needs. This could be interpreted as the hubris of someone currently with privilege assuming that others are like them. And lastly it does not make large mention of how it would fit in a multiplicity of different communication strategies, as a pluralist might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVC has a grand concept, which works at times and is undermined by it's flaws at others. It was useful for me because it was the first conflict strategy I'd heard of, and it "made sense" to me. It turned out not to be a persuasion-hack, but it did teach me the concept of empathy. Understanding empathy for the first time was truly a dose of mind expansion. I've kept the format of NVC's exercises at the end of each chapter, because as contrived as it seems, the questions are hard, empathy is not intuitive, and practice is vital. It's really more praxis than theory. In fact, practising empathy has been the inroad to new ideologies for me like: feminism, anti-racism, LGBTQ-allyship, and other social movements for which I am not the effected demographic. I hope you, person who likes mathematical analogies, can glean something studying from it too.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essays"></category></entry><entry><title>Notconfusing rules for conversation: 2 rules and a jumpstart.</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/notconfusing-rules-for-conversation-2-rules-and-a-jumpstart.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-25T22:34:00-07:00</published><updated>2015-06-25T22:34:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2015-06-25:/notconfusing-rules-for-conversation-2-rules-and-a-jumpstart.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Meeting people can be a slog.

"Hello, what's your name?", "Where are you from?", "What do you do?",  "How do you yawn?". Yawn? Sorry I was nodding off just writing about how repetitive and tiresome modern meeting and greeting can be. Owing to the way that social networks store information about us, we're used to thinking about people in a list of attributes "forms" structure. Trans-inclusive feminism has already laid out how select-a-value gender is problematic for self-determination, and it has even subtler consequences in meeting people. We've come to assume the next person you meet is some combinatoric permutation of drop-down menus. How are we supposed to meet that person that is our life long friend, but at the moment is just looks like one more INTJ or Virgo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact the disillusionment from these gruelling social interactions is exactly the motivation for having friends, as a commiserating shelter. How do we let humans do the human thing and wow us with their outstanding creative expression of self from the moment we first meet? I submit notconfusing's two rules for conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask questions that reflect choices people have or could make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask questions that have never been asked before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking questions that reflect choices or decisions is a way to understand a person's values and principles, which is more informative than part of their current happenstance. Even though this point is supposed to cause a deeper understanding, the questions need not be heavy. "When you're sleeping on your favourite side, are you facing towards your alarm clock?" might tell you a bit about how much someone wants to combat their own habits without asking "how cognisant are you of your habits and how do you want to combat them?" The analysis of their choices can be done together out loud or both parties can be trusted to do so internally. In either case the point is to revel in the complexity of your partner, while gifting them a bit of Rogerian psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that just Rule 1 by itself could still allow for a "What are your hobbies?" variant, so Rule 2 is brought in to stem the tedium. At first it might seem impossible to ask an entirely unique question to every person, but - as I will prove - there really are an infinite number of these types of questions. Here are a few strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first strategy is analogous to a infinite game I learned called "Uses for..." where you try to come up with as many uses as you can for a specific item. The example I recall reading about is a bed sheet. So let's play: It can be used as a tablecloth, as an escape rope for climbing out windows, as a substitute for an all-white painting, as a shooting target for short-sighted people, as a stencil for papier-mâché bed etc. etc. Try and come up with 5 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now apply  creative riffing to the things you notice about your partner. For instance these are the topics I brought up from the last ice-breaking conversations I've had: reminiscing over video rental returns (standing near a letterbox), a comparison of how different tapes will tear when you don't have scissors (electrical taped wallet), how often I think about life from a bird's-eye view (standing at different levels), and the history of the vulcanization of rubber (rode with a flat tyre). Going &lt;em&gt;off-script&lt;/em&gt; and generating questions based on the partner and surroundings guarantees freshness. The way your associate engages gives you some understanding of their gestalt person-ness.&lt;br&gt;
Even if you are feeling like you filled out pointless forms all day at work so that you are sapped of your free-associativity, there is always the &lt;em&gt;abstraction "meta" trick&lt;/em&gt;. Assume that you have racked your brain, and "where are you from?" is the absolute best question you can come up with because you are only meeting people out of some hateful obligation. You can apply &lt;em&gt;question-abstraction to&lt;/em&gt; ask them "what does a person's answer to \&amp;lt;absolute best question I can muster&gt; mean about a person's personality?" Yes, use your own staleness as weapon. Since the result of the &lt;em&gt;question-abstraction&lt;/em&gt; is also a question, it can be infinitely applied to itself to yield infinitely many unique questions. QED. (If you think this a sad proof, then I encourage you to really try it. I imagine you'll become loopy enough by the hypnotic repetition of speaking that your co-discusser will either join in with you in your recursion - great fun - or they will have walked away, which is just a well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last technique, if you want to borrow a bit, is to use my &lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/nuclear-icebreakers-for-your-group/"&gt;growing list of ice-breakers.&lt;/a&gt;  I've created them as group introductions when I was facilitating Sudo Room hackerspace meetings. As they are targeted to a tech-y crowd you may need to customize a bit -  exactly the point that I'm trying to champion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the application of these 2 rules you begin to transgress social mores for great good. You ought to explode small talk to eschew complacency. Then you can make more and better friends. Although ironically making this kind of conversation may have effect of pinning you as a werido. Yet disobey the laziness of phone alienation as Saul Williams does in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1S7qTsW5SY"&gt;Talk to Strangers&lt;/a&gt;  "... that square box don't represent the sphere that we live in.

The concept of  &lt;a href="http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/107974"&gt;"smooth" versus "striated" spaces &lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/107974"&gt;(striated means lined or striped)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://dare.uva.nl/document/2/107974"&gt;by Deleuze and Guattari&lt;/a&gt;, is a stream of philosophy with a missing interpretation through soup.&lt;br&gt;
Depending on your choice of violent conflict, the smooth/striated dichotomy has popularly been depicted &lt;a href="http://bldgblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/nakatomi-space.html"&gt;in the film "Die Hard"&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wikis.nyu.edu/download/attachments/14587915/Weizman_lethal+theory.pdf"&gt;the 2002 Israeli Operation in Nablus.&lt;/a&gt; In those scenarios parties moved not through the striated spaces of elevators, stairs, streets and squares, but through smooth and direct routes like air ducts and holes cut in walls.&lt;br&gt;
I prefer a more pastoral example to grasp the notion of seeing a smooth space under a striated one. Northern Californian valleys are, by default, quite literally a smooth space with rolling hills. A striated framework is imposed on top of them in the from of designated walking paths. This New Year's Day I was hiking there with some friends when our crew realized that the right side of the bifurcated path we took was a dead-end about 10 metres in. Some walked backwards along the right path to the junction point to continue down the left path, but my girlfriend Adi walked across the imaginary hypotenuse directly thereby stepping off any of the paths. That is seeing the smooth under the striated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soups are the ultimate smooth in the foodspace. You can eat any part of the soup, at any time, by gracefully carving through the three-dimensional liquid with your spoon. The same cannot be said for a pie, sweet or savoury, as it has an inside and an outside, and a top and a bottom layer. Because of this you must eat its parts in an order, and that order may come with a value judgement. Likewise a burrito in foil is not smooth, it is a striated space of one stripe - you are supposed to eat it front to back in linear order. Even a combination of potatoes and peas on a plate must cross the threshhold of your lips in some discrete relative positional arrangement. That is not true for the soup group; a hummus, a miso, or a lentil stew. You can eat those in any order - or rather there's no order speak of. There being no order frees us from their being judgement of how we eat and eschews a level of social etiquette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the great social orders and hierarchies that exist, at least in the Western world today, is the in relationship space. The way I have been taught to view relationships in my life, largely donated by the patriarchy, is striated. Here is a map of the mental conception of the pathways of relationships for me. I wonder how true it is for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2015/01/striated-space.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Striated Relationship Space" class="size-large wp-image-3632" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2015/01/striated-space.jpg" style="width:474px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Striated Relationship Space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not look like a soup. It is much more like a high road or a main drag, with a few side alleys you might find yourself unlucky enough to fall into. Relationships, says the striated-theory, are places to go with junctions and turns to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's just one way to view it. In fact, in a conversation I was having with another partner last year, we decided to start having less sex. Quite easily we could slip into viewing this as that we were "Friends with Benefits" or "non-exclusive partners" now moving into the "Friend zone". Let's resist the temptation to impose striation. Let's think about it as soup. The relationship space is more greatly simplified when soupified in smooth-theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2015/01/smooth-space1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Smooth Relationship Space" class="size-large wp-image-3636" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2015/01/smooth-space1.jpg" style="width:474px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Smooth Relationship Space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2015/01/smooth.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="smooth" class="wp-image-3698 size-large" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2015/01/smooth.jpg" style="width:474px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Updated: A second way to think about a soupier model without an explicit time axis, although the a curve is drawn inside the space to demonstrate how a relationship might evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Notes: the image I have drawn here is not accurate for the relationship I described in the last paragraph. Additonally if anyone wants to take a stab at redrawing the smooth relationship space without a time axis I would be glad to post alternate imaginings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the relationships-as-soup-iverse, that conversation can be viewed as a modification of the composition of soup. The soup still exists, it might taste different, it might be more or less substantive, but it is still soup. Transferring the notion that soup has no order and carries no judgement, likewise the relationship is never eaten, or slurped wrongly. You cannot break etiquette or convention by having traversed the relationship roads poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I found this viewpoint I was relieved because I was having fears about whether I'd broken her expectations, or upsetted the social order between our mutual friends. When I switched from viewing relationships as a striation of discrete statuses, to a smooth soup of two people, I was liberated in a small way. Liberated because the framework had no room for our mutually-agreed feelings to be against-the-grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps relationships, like soups, don't have distinguishable parts that can be assembled in the wrong order. Let your soup act as a tiny reminder to the see the smooth under the striated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Responses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received this facebook comment, which I found instructive on how striated relationship space can frustrate those that aren't willing to submit to a complete striation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a warm afternoon in Paradies - the park in Jena, Thuringia - exuberant children were pretending to be snakes and crocodiles, and I was attempting to understand what I wanted to pretend to be. My current thought was that a PhD in the computer science / information science realm with a focus on Free Culture was a path forwards as I explained to my mentor Daniel Mietchen. Neither persuaded nor unconvinced he socratically proposed, like the Free Open Culture advocate that he is, to open the problem up. That is he suggested that I should do an "Open PhD". It's first component he said should be blog post entitled "Should I Do My PhD in the Open?" which to serve as basic argument that I could come back to in the eventuality of a PhD-induced depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the fundamental question of motivation. Since I let this post sit in draft-phase too long, and started my applications before finishing it, I can no longer provide application-untainted answers. Let us use that fact to design a new avenue of inquiry. To answer the questions of "what?" and "why?" we can analyse my responses to the basic components of a typical PhD application, Statement of Purpose, Personal History, CV and Letters of recommendation. To answer the question of "how?", I will take the advice of Annie Dillard's quote, and use an &lt;a href="https://github.com/notconfusing/open-phd-application"&gt;open git repository&lt;/a&gt; to express my opinions about and share my applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;[Research Agenda]{#research} - What I Aim To Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased with the research proposal that I've laid out in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/notconfusing/open-phd-application/blob/master/UCB/Statement%20of%20Purpose%20-%20UC%20Berkeley.pdf"&gt;Statement of Purpose&lt;/a&gt;. It's sufficiently grand and challenging, and the start of the path lays right where my past has delivered me.  I lay out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[...] a research agenda to classify the already-known social biases by as they appear in the socio-technical fora, and then to search for unidentified phenomena using those classifications. As an explanatory example, create a statistical model of how the known skewed distributions gender, race, and nationality exist in Wikidata, and then inspect &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the property distributions for properties that match the biased patterns. The project grows more complex by allowing property-pairs (e.g. gender by race), different social-technical communities (e.g. Freebase, OpenStreetMap), and different models of bias (e.g. editorship-measures). If successful we may find overlooked stigmas and phobias in society, and all the while building a massive Open Dataset of comparative indexes of known social biases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I particularly like about this proposal is that it drives at the limits of our knowledge - the term for that I use for it is "Rumsfeldian Unknown Unknowns" (not that I ever had an &lt;a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000182.html"&gt;opinion about his politics but it's a stand-up phrase&lt;/a&gt;). The problem excites me because its in the vein of "what is reality?" but lays out a plan to answer that more scientifically than philosophically. It's also got enough holes - in that I need to learn more about machine learning, and enough strong points - in that I've already been parsing and analysing these current data sets. The fact that the question touches and expands on the currently hotly discussed gender gap is an added bonus for application-appeal, but is only coincidental because I really have been thinking about the bias problem in abstract form before I knew about the gender-gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Ambition - Why I Aim To Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personal statement - which at the time of this writing remains a few scribbled notes - should, when finished, attest to two strands: mind expansion, and a battle with self-discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wept, the first time I witnessed in clear terms my internalized racism. Well actually I ran away from a protest when I became cognizant that I was listening to the black and female speakers less than the others, and then later I cried. In the underground computer lab, pouring my thoughts into a text editor, I clarified that my thoughts were a product of unquestioned norms, but verifiably wrong nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other strand is about materializing an internal cattle-prod to make my productivity commensurate with whatever natural sharpness I have and however much middle-class privilege it might have derived from. It took some time to start trusting the feeling that I was &lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/lessons-from-dogsitting-the-necessary-collar/" title="Lessons from Dogsitting: The Necessary Collar"&gt;as dependent on a master as a dog&lt;/a&gt;,  and to &lt;a href="http://notconfusing.com/what-part-of-school-dont-you-understand/" title="What Part of “School” Don’t You Understand?"&gt;stop trying to please schoolteachers&lt;/a&gt; (even if they were my actually bosses). But now I've quit my job to live frugally on open source contracts, and research for autodidactic pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you take extreme measures to avoid being involved with any institutions you'll always need a CV. In creating &lt;a href="https://github.com/notconfusing/open-phd-application/blob/master/Maximilian%20Klein%20Resume%20School%20of%20Information%20.pdf?raw=true"&gt;mine so far&lt;/a&gt; I seem to over-mention "Wikipedia." It's not a terrible thing, but a reminder to focus the idea on 'socio-technical' systems in general and not on any one of them in specific. This is as true for a reframing of my thoughts as much as it is a single document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seeing what I'm focusing on in my personal history, I have to remember the importance using of my privilege correctly. Typically the notion of a personal history is to talk about the overcoming of disadvantages. Being middle-income, male, white, tall, relatively straight, and a native-English speaker means prejudice is lower in my life. The real disadvantage that comes with being so advantaged is the difficulty not to admit or check your privilege. It's hard to champion change in the world when you'd be least benefited by it - but that is the only interesting course of history from here. This is why what I want to do is be able to hold a statistical mirror to the internet and maybe that will be able to awaken a few disbelievers. (Get 'em where it hurts - right in the logic, I know their weakness.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lesson Needed - Who I Aim To Impress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my applications I am clearly trying to impress someone or something, and a more pointed question is what I want from them? Most of what I think a program would give me are: more education, more professional experience and career preparation, and the pressure-shelter to focus on answering my research agenda. Ultimately then I want things out of myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the education point, there are some clear fields of study to improve. Studying social science is to put a finer tipped question onto the fumbly one I am asking now about bias. Studying machine learning and statistics are aimed to automate pattern recognition tasks that I've proposed in my research agenda. I anticipate having not much problem with my mathematics background in learning these things. In fact I secretly look forward to the endorphin rush of expanding my repertoire.  I only partly fear my personality rejecting the classroom setting and it's hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of career preparedness the main thing I am trying to avoid is having a boss, or more accurately, avoiding needing a boss. That is not supposed to mean that I would like to learn the entrepreneurial art of "being your own boss," since you would still have one at that point, just you would be it. If I could meet, be advised, teach, read, and work all in the direction of pursuing a goal that I've freely made for myself by myself then I would have met the goal that I'm making for myself right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the purpose of a doctoral study program to answer a long standing personal question would be a new height of self-fulfilment. It's only a useful coincidence that other people will certainly benefit form the results along the way. However if I were doing it for the side-effect then I may have come to the wrong turn. But how will I know if I've lost my way? This is where the point of openness reigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Point of Openness - How I Aim To Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I see the title "Should I Do My PhD In The Open?" I already see a misplaced emphasis. The question rhetorically centres around openness - that is, whether to apply the principles and ethos of Open and Libre culture to my academic pursuits. That aspect however is the most trivial. "Yes" is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to expand the idea of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Notebook_Science"&gt;Open Notebook Science&lt;/a&gt; one step further. Imagine a whole PhD as an Open Notebook project. Even it's pre-formulations should go online 'as it happens'. Today, the emotions surrounding, and meta-questions of my PhD are online before I've even applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point of Linus' law is validity through mass scrutiny. The point of mass scrutiny is  the topic of my thesis. And the topic of my thesis is the point of the important questions in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

Paperback (\$9), ePub and PDF (Free). &lt;a href="http://23rdcenturyromance.com/"&gt;http://23rdcenturyromance.com/&lt;/a&gt;. ISBN: 978-1492134237&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a human on Alpha Centauri such that physics dictates that you can never physically be in the same time or space as this human. Now add the twist, that you have a magical instant messenger or Skype connection with that human. Would you consider having a (not necessarily monogamous) relationship with that person? That is the "Alpha Centauri relationship" thought experiment - would you consider having an entirely online having boyfriend or girlfriend? Some would say that despite the lack of physical connection, a meaningful psychological one could still be had, and that Alpha Centauri relationship could be part of a larger mosiac of relationships which could together be completely fufilling, if we do not require partner exclusivity. Others say that you could never know a person well enough without a face to face rapport. Not delving too deeply into possible answers, let us follow a corollary that stems from the thought experiment: if you lose the ability to verify a person's humanness then you implicitly accept a relationship with what could be a sophisticated programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2013/09/23crscreen.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="23crscreen" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-330" src="https://notconfusing.com/images/uploads/2013/09/23crscreen.png" style="width:300px !important"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23rd Century Romance (23CR) takes online relationships one step further. If your willing to engage in algorithmic companionship, then why not code it to be the most hyperrealistic, ultrapleasurable, extrahuman companionship possible? That's the central question in 23CR: standard human-sexuality versus next generation R-sexuality (as it's called).  Each side is debated between opposing advocates, in the emo, cat-stroking Rai and his roommate Morph, the pill-popping, katana-wielding Matrix-ode. Rai searches for a more authentic human love while Morph thinks that he's already exceeded the potential love that Rai could find. Within the first chapter Morph already opines "I'm R-sexual because real women are less... what's the word? 'Womanly' than virtual women." Rai then counterstrikes "The secret to life is accepting and being comfortable with what you have and who you are!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without spoiling, the two young men do start to entertain each other's viewpoints, and this is where the most thought provoking parts of the tale occur. Even the adherents and appreciators of inferior real (i.e non-virtual) sex and real friends necessarily facilitate part of their relationship "in Virtual". Sometimes they vary their sex lives with virtual, but they might also use the channel to just talk about their days. They have to admit and inherently reconcile that they probably met in virtual and meet in real because they chat in virtual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You needn't be 200 years in the future to already feel this reality. We owe our relationships, to some degree, to technology because it at minimum allows us to coordinate it. That likely remains true even for those who've deleted their facebook account but use email, and still tote a dumbphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stylistically, as Rai and Morph argue at length, and over many 3D-printed meals and robo-drinks, the reader is barraged with fantasy cliche and lewd, juvenille, American-heteronormative hyperbole. You will appreciatie these flairs in proportion to how "awesome" you think lasers and unicorns are. Hartnell joyfully jumps between Nazi spy seduction and shtupping elven princesses. 23CR definitely does not pass the &lt;a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4165246"&gt;Bechdel Test,&lt;/a&gt; and if you have any feminist inclinations you might become offended by male teenager wet dream of the future descriptions. Although at one point Hartnell appears aware of this bias through Rai's inner dialogue, "&lt;em&gt;Window shopping. I'm window shopping for girls. &lt;/em&gt;Surely that was the wrong way to think about it. He wasn't comparing 'products.'" Therefore it is not clear whether the misogyny is an intentional compulsion that is in fact a caution to the dangers we face from software reliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world of 23CR is of augmented reality, gel-filled spacepods for cyberdreaming, and the choice to take "Love" pills. There is a sideplot that harkens to the Matrix where a human attempts to fight the robotic outsourcing of his job. But the revolution fizzles immediately, and the impression given by the protagonist Rai is complicit subjection to the artificial world. That becomes true for the banality of real relationships and sex at some of his junctions too. Amateur righteous rebellion against power structures is conspicuous by its absence in 23CR. That is also true of Hartnell's first offering in independent book publishing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essays"></category></entry><entry><title>Book Review: Working with MediaWiki</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/book-review-working-with-mediawiki.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-29T22:15:00-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-29T22:15:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2012-10-29:/book-review-working-with-mediawiki.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working with MediaWiki&lt;/strong&gt; by Yaron Koren : WikiWorks Press: 227 pages.

&lt;p&gt;Working with MediaWiki is the latest MediaWiki (MW) book to be released since March 2010, when MW1.15 was current (today in November 2012 Wikipedia uses 1.21). The text is split into two logical and spiritual halves. The first is a &lt;em&gt;from-scratch&lt;/em&gt; guide to setting up and tuning MediaWiki in the style of the classical wiki we are used to seeing on the web today. That treatment covers best practices, as well as where two put the right type of brackets for the impatient coder. Although not in it's title, the latter half of the book is dedicated to Semantic MediaWiki (SMW), the only book to be published on the topic yet. Denser and more demanding in attention, this sector takes a more &lt;em&gt;theory of semantic data&lt;/em&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If followed sequentially from the front cover you'll be led through a tour of the MediaWiki ant colony, only exploring when ready the ill-lit underground veins. The audience is assumed to be those who are unafraid copying mark-up snippets (even if they don't know exactly what it means) and are tasked with creating a Wiki from fresh installation. Yet this 'from nothing' format is not too painful for more advanced users as the explanations are concise without being cursory.  By page 11 you are into the example-driven world of MW-specific issues in a parade-march that is imaginiative yet infomrative - akin to some kind of stylistic cross between National Geographic, and a Math textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with chapters such as &lt;em&gt;Setting up-&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;Editing in-,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Organization of-,&lt;/em&gt; MediaWiki, you can have a tangible website at toaster oven, if not microwave speeds. By page 179, when you'll have finished &lt;em&gt;User Management, Extensions, &lt;/em&gt;and *Running a Successful Wiki, * your historical Pinball Machine wiki (or whatever it is that you're building) will be indistinguishably on par with any other that you'll have come across as a netizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this isn't just a walkthrough. Read as a random access referrence manual, each two page long subsection of the 23 chapters is as easy to navigate via the Table of Contents as it to digest as modicum of help. In fact, however arcane it seems to look something up in the ToC for a piece of software whose official documentation is stored in a Wiki itself, there are some invaluable upshots to this seemingly outdated search methodology. The foremost of which is that unlike the free online documentation, or other books which take as a template the online documentation, having a &lt;em&gt;curated &lt;/em&gt;index is as much of a discovery tool as it is a finding aid. Even as someone who builds MediaWikis professionally, skimming int the ToC gave me the answers to long standing questions that search never returned; how to display outside images, and the scene of social extensions. Koren often stops midway through abstract technical discussions to say "typically this feature is used as [...]," or  "on Wikipedia this works like [...]," which again speaks to the fact that this book is not just about MediaWiki, but how exactly others have worked with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the second half, you encounter Semantic MediaWiki. Probably you have never used., or heard of SMW.  Koren acknowledges its relative obscurity and builds a compelling argument for its usage throughout its explanation's unfolding. But first, what is it? "In conjunction with its extensions, SMW can transform a regular wiki into a kind of  collaborative database." SMW is, roughly,  about pages and bits of pages having &lt;em&gt;properties. &lt;/em&gt;As the canoncial example goes Berlin's population being 3.5 million people, really means that &lt;em&gt;subject&lt;/em&gt; Berlin, &lt;em&gt;predicate &lt;/em&gt;has population of, &lt;em&gt;object &lt;/em&gt;3.5 million humans. Here you can see a more theoretical leaning in SMW than MW. Whether or not this is caused by Koren's  'nose being too close' to the matter, the tutorial becomes less example-driven and more of an academic and technical treatise. That is hardly surprising as Koren was heavily involved in the SMW extension programming scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change in approach is not necesarily a bad thing. Although wikis have their standard uses as encyclopedias of varying scopes, there are some creative examples of their usage: blogging, study forums, and fan clubs to name a few. MW has thus been explored as a software many times more than SMW. This fact combined with the greater extensibility of SMW means that SMW is fertile for unimagined projects and uses. Koren's treatment in gradually growing more abstract can serve the purpose of allowing the readers' neurons fire more freely - especially coming after the varied, but static examples in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact that motif of universal expression, the complex but large degree of freedom in semantic mark-up is the overarching theme there. The lesson that Koren expounds about Semantic MediaWiki is that since SMW structures can become some infinitely and obsessively detailed, that presenting a user with a blank text editor will be greeted with a blank stare. Thus for a successful SMW, the onus of development is firstly on the administrator, to make a skeleton which users can flesh out. The chapter on &lt;em&gt;Semantic Forms &lt;/em&gt;here does describes the solution.  Likewise, building a SMW will mean that you will manufacture freight containers of machine-readable data. In the chapters of &lt;em&gt;Semantic Queries, Drilldown, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;RDF and SPARQL&lt;/em&gt;, Koren provides an manual on how to write the right punctuation characters to get machines to read and elucidate the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books' ending does duty in touching on a list of remaining topics which Koren deems indispensible. Collecting miscellaneous details on technical, but practical matters of debugging, multi-language concerns, and data migration among others, there is a sense that Koren is imparting notes kept during his own journey with MW. Lastly you can feel Koren's earnest passion in the ultimate chapter titled &lt;em&gt;MediaWiki development: a guide for the accidental developer&lt;/em&gt;, a map he discovered himself in the field, after his own 6 addicted years as a (S)MW developer, and author of 12 extensions. That is precisely the selling point of Working With MediaWiki: you are not so much reading a book, as sipping diet cokes while sitting cross-legged next to Koren in the back of a lecture hall with a laptop at a developer convention - a private tutorial from the geek himself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essays"></category></entry><entry><title>Editing Girl Talk</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/editing-girl-talk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-19T08:02:00-08:00</published><updated>2011-12-19T08:02:00-08:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2011-12-19:/editing-girl-talk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's a problem on Wikipedia, one that I am, as a male, not entirely qualified to answer, but has nonetheless incessantly perturbed me.

Women have been &lt;a href="http://www.wikipediasurvey.org/docs/Wikipedia_Overview_15March2010-FINAL.pdf"&gt;statistically shown&lt;/a&gt; to edit Wikipedia far less than their population proportion would suggest. As noted in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Faith_Collaboration"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Faith Collaboration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Joseph Reagle, an encyclopedia reflects it's authorship. Naturally the question arises, what can be done about the gender gap? I contend there is a glimmer of hope in finding a solution and the first ray shone on my face from the LCD when facebook news fed me this picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie, a student of the &lt;a href="http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Education_Program"&gt;Wikipedia Education Program&lt;/a&gt; in her proud post showed that something was happening correctly. That there was something cool, so edgy in fact that it was facebook-worthy, about editing, and that the appeal wasn't male-only. In Wikipedia terms the fight against skewed writer demographics is known as "Countering Systemic Bias," and the Wikipedia Education Program is doing just that. The logic goes that university students, the target of the Education Program, are evenly divided or woman-heavy in terms of gender, and so having them edit as an assignment would start steering averages. Now more affirmation is being received for that hypothesis, but also important details are arising in how exactly the bias manifests itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zachary McDowell's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:United_States_Education_Program/Courses/Writing_as_Communication_(Zachary_McDowell)"&gt;Writing as Communication&lt;/a&gt; course, a participant in the Education Program under my ambassadorship of the New England Wikipedia Brains In Education (NEWBIE) region, came second on the &lt;a href="http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Education_Program/Fall_2011/Leaderboard_US"&gt;leaderboard&lt;/a&gt; of text added amongst all classes. Upon investigating the work conducted in the course my eyes pricked up at some of the topics chosen. They were gender conscious and underrepresented. Zachary McDowell  related to me that his students, of which 75% are female, were relishing the assignment, and that having been given the option of choosing whatever article they wanted to edit they were selecting poignant and telling subjects about gender. Immediately I tracked down some of the top female editors and interviewed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Daniellecomm375" title="User:Daniellecomm375"&gt;Daniellecomm375&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Eff_Gjeni" title="User:Eff Gjeni"&gt;Eff Gjeni&lt;/a&gt;, main contributors to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_music_videos"&gt;Sexuality in Music Videos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_advertisement"&gt;Gender Advertisement&lt;/a&gt; respectively are two top performing students of the course, and had meaningfully nonchalant answers to my questioning them. Neither of them was aware of an existing gender gap in the encyclopedia they'd been editing when we talked. Neither of them thought that they were writing about topics that were explicitly feminine, they rightly pointed out were human topics. Still, their choice of topics uncovered less explored areas in the encyclopedia, and their experience highlighted some potential male bias in Wikipedia policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In answering the question of why she chose her topic Daniellecomm375 pleaded &lt;em&gt;write what you know. &lt;/em&gt;"My friends and I are always talking about things like 'can you believe how skinny that actress is?'" she offhands in seriousness that is not distant from the gossipy nature she is describing. The presence of ideas like thinness paranoia, a common conversation for Daniellecomm375 and her friends, were skeletal at best on Wikipedia. She continues, "I wanted to make the article relatable." And certainly to a specific demographic Sexuality in Music Videos is. Discussions of body image, the prevalence of anorexia, and misogyny are treated, and it's hard to imagine being as committed to the dispersal of the research around it if you can't relate to the symptoms. Daniellecomm375 was filling a vacuum she noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eff Gjeni likewise was not successful in finding issues close to her daily life. "I wanted to write about fashion first, but there weren't many articles on it," she laments, as an indication of existing bias. Having settled on Gender Advertising, she still disputes that the discipline is an innately female subject, "We think that it's a problem that images in advertising show that women are supposed to be a certain way, but I wanted to talk about men in the article, it's hard for men too." Here she enforced that she wasn't writing with a feminist slant, and her article indeed voices an equal, and clinical tone. It's well put that the topics are about genders, none in specific. Still, a topic as large as Gender Advertising remaining immature into 2011 is reflective of the notion that it takes a multiplicity of authors and author backgrounds to write on the sum total of human knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anecdote that Daniellecomm375 deconstructs for me seems to suggest that perhaps the answer has some historical moorings. "The first day of class, when I heard that we were going to edit Wikipedia articles, I can remember looking around the class and thinking [of the 25% men] the boys are going to do much better than I am." Daniellecomm375 ranked second in the individual category of the leaderboard, so while reality being exactly opposite, where is the psychology stemming from I inquired? "I think it's in the academic tradition, as a women you don't feel like you'll be taken seriously in university, so if someone knows you're a woman on Wikipedia you think they're also not going to take you seriously." With an upright posture and a grim message Daniellecom375 is a statue of a regrettable matter of fact. The gender role of timidity again rises when Danielle recounts the emotional pain of an edit war she was involved in. "I asked him [presuming the warring editor is a 'him'] do you not want me to edit your article? Because if you don't, I won't." To Danielle any cracked eggs are failure, not the making of an omelette. Some official principles, such as "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Bold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in editing Wikipedia," Danielle seems to suggest are not readily part of a behavior with which she associates. It lays the underpinnings for more clashing, something that is not part of her socialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I brought up the subject of hurt feelings with Eff Gjeni a diversity of opinion is shown. I ask her about the prevailing theory - extolled even by Jimmy Wales himself at the latest Wikimania - that the increase of negative bot-left warnings on user pages has brought about a harsher climate for editors. The corollary of the theory being that women, who are more consensus based decision makers, like less the impersonalized tone and algorithmic arrival of warning text. "I don't find the messages discouraging at all," she twists "it makes me want to correct the mistakes." So with that golden key to the mystery evaporating I ask Eff Gjeni what she thinks can be done? She lingers wordlessly in thought for a few moments and responds "I think that if the gender gap was advertised more, it would make women want to edit more." The internet's less frequently clicked destinations have been typically the haunts of a distinct clique. Simply allowing something to be moused, won't mean it will be in equal measures by all sexes, Eff Gjeni surmises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wikipedia Education Program is finding editors who were oblivious to the gender gap, and starting to mend it. Systemic bias is being countered with the likes of Daniellecomm375 and Eff Gjeni's contributions because they have found an outlet to which they weren't previously privy. Moreover, it is nourishing their transition from newbies to fluent editors, through it's structure and campus ambassador support system. On whether they would continue to edit now that courses have finished, both gave a resounding "definitely." There are subtle hints also that some long-ago agreed tenets - like Be Bold - might be borne under biased times, and to gather worthwhile feedback we will need the voices of those less represented. With the new Wikipedia reader &lt;a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikipedia_Editors_Survey_November_2011#How_can_I_take_the_survey.3F"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; statistics being collected at the moment, one question of which is "Gender:" we will be able to see if there is any trend in the gender gap. The Wikipedia Education Program may be of insignificant magnitude at the moment to move the needle, but it is a growing laboratory that is discovering potent remedies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essays"></category></entry><entry><title>Lessons from Songles</title><link href="https://notconfusing.com/lessons-from-songles.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-09-29T12:10:00-07:00</published><updated>2011-09-29T12:10:00-07:00</updated><author><name>max</name></author><id>tag:notconfusing.com,2011-09-29:/lessons-from-songles.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the last page of Jaron Lanier's &lt;em&gt;You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;,typically where you expect some encompassing conclusion, you will receive the baffling premonition of, “I imagine a virtual saxophone-like instrument in virtual reality with which I can improvise both golden tarantulas and a bucket with all …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the last page of Jaron Lanier's &lt;em&gt;You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;,typically where you expect some encompassing conclusion, you will receive the baffling premonition of, “I imagine a virtual saxophone-like instrument in virtual reality with which I can improvise both golden tarantulas and a bucket with all the red things. If I knew how to build it now, I would, but I don't.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which if you have read all the pages as well as the last one, in true order, you will find to be fitting conclusion. For the &lt;em&gt;manifesto&lt;/em&gt; is much more a poorly meshed attempt to collect his small findings, gigs, opinions and brainstorms since his day prototyping Virtual Reality in the 80s. As if it were a magic mortar Lanier attempts to congeal and tie his non-sequential thoughts together with large claims in technology's meaning for humanity. Yet owing to it's anecdotal format what is produced can sometimes seem just a griping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance it is claimed that, unlike the 60's, music today has no definitive style. To prove this he's supposedly made bets with adolescents that he's come across, played them a song and then asked them if the song was from 1998 or 2008. Jaron reports that they weren't able to tell the difference. The quality of this study is not particular solid. Remaining consistent with his unfounded speculation and exaggerated extrapolation are other claims about how contemporary User Interface design robs us of our humanity. This is evident in the supposed fact that Facebook's relationship status multiple choice decision is making us more binary, computational, and less human. I chose not to “like” this claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairhandedly though, while swinging his arms madly, every so often Lanier lands a punch. On the topic of Music Piracy he admits that as much as we might want to tell the Recording Associations and their labels that they should have adapted to new technologies long ago and are now paying the price in their downfall, there is scarce constructive criticism at how they might do that. This is a valid proposition because it is unreasonable to expect change without knowing what the change is you really want. It is not that requesting the Record Industry to adapt is burdensome, but that without giving them some direction they really are the victims they make themselves out to be. Victimisation does not excuse any scare tactics they might use or past extortion they may have committed, but we ought to be at least slightly more sympathetic to their problem if we can't propose better solutions than they are implementing. Therefore we should be frantically brainstorming suggests Lanier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us join him for a moment. We don our VR goggles and boldly slip on our datagloves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take as a working assumption that in the future we would still like recompense as an incentive for creating music. This means there is a nearly untenable need to monetise a nearly free commodity. Owing to that difficulty only the most outlandish and novel innovations ever rear their heads from consumer-thinkers. We've seen &lt;em&gt;flattr&lt;/em&gt; which has it's advantage in ease, but still relies on altruism. There was a poster in Berkeley's iSchool (can anyone identify this author) proposing that buying songs should also give you fractional—albeit marginally diminishing—profits in the subsequent purchases of the same song. Therefore you would have an incentive to buy as you could eventually recoup most of your money if more people bought the song. Certainly this is a novelty but it may taste too much like a ponzi scheme for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of torrents the economics of ratios and seedboxes I once offered could become a profitable market following an analogy to that of solar energy. The seedbox bandwidth would be rented out to you for a fixed monthly price, and the higher your ratio at the end of the month the more you'd earn back. This would be scaled in such a way that the most advanced users could potentially even yield cash from the grid, but the average user would pay in. The desire to spend on music relies again on the profit incentive, and also on the fact that some community organised torrent trackers often surpass commercial libraries in selection and quality because of long-tail effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanier provides a third imagining of charging for music in the future: &lt;em&gt;songles&lt;/em&gt;. Songles are fashionably packaged RFID dongles which play music on a remote stereo. That is you wear a digitally connected bracelet (or it could be on your keychain) which would beam the song(s) contained within to a nearby hi-fi. The idea might succeed for more reasons than what he touches in his manifesto. The idea might succeed because there is a desire to share our songs with our friends. The concept has been proved since Lanier published in 2010 with turntable.fm . The magic of turntable.fm is that everyone in a room vies to become 1 of 5 DJs who then rotate between playing songs of their choosing. Basically this allows braggadocio of taste, which is a powerful sociological force. Turntable.fm right now works through the browser, which is not very convenient as you want to physically rather than digitally bob your head. The key companion hardware for a songle answers this physicality, it is the auto-DJ console that shuffles through the songs contained within partygoers wrists, necks, and pockets. The party DJing is directly crowdsourced which makes an appealing dynamic. Similarly the same would work at a coffeeshop or pub who's public music could be selected passively from the patrons. The argument that such corporate institutions would be averse to relinquishing the power over their carefully designed atmosphere could be trumped by their own profit motives. That is, if the music that is played in a shop to induce you to buy is less effective at increasing sales than allowing people to listen to their own music, then businessmen may be on board. Music opinions are a neverending conversation amongst many today, something that could be valuably capitalised upon to save the moribund paradigm of paid music creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The songles have their main revenue source in the fact that they are physical and therefore you must buy them, says Lanier. Not exactly so, I see Geeky students on ebay buying RFID read/writers making a business out of slipping cheap chips from China to their friends. Additionally from the same crowd I foresee a new tsunami of Rickrolling at Starbucks. The songle ecosystem is not hacker-proof, but it for success it only need to be more hacker-resillent than CD-ripping. Therefore a glimmer of hope may yet exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether songles will triumph or not, the idea is at least emblematic of the sort of thinking that frees consumers from their current hypocrisy towards the old institutions. Importantly it is born of the same creativity that dreams psychedelic spider-conjuring eSaxophones. The lesson that can be learned here is that we must imagine what it is that we would pay for in music to allow a chance for paid music creation to survive. I imagine a virtual lounge-like club in virtual reality in which I can mingle with other listeners of the same song, and inspect artefacts related to the artist and genre. If I knew how to build it now, I would, but I don't.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="essays"></category></entry></feed>
