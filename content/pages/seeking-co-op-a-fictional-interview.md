To explain myself here's a fictional interview as if I were in the East Bay Express:

East Bay Express: Firstly, Can you supply a picture for the publication?

Max: Smile!

(Mechanical whirring of a Polaroid).

EBX: So Max, you're not new to the East Bay co-op scene, but you're not settled. What gives?

Max: It's a matter of circumstance really. I was just away for a multi-month globe-adventure, in the near future I want to buy a house for the longterm, and currently want a stop gap to "synchro-mesh" between those two states.

Community is crucial. You don't want to sit in your living room alone; you also don't want sit next to an obsessive pillow-fluffer, and yet you still want to be offered tea when they're making. You've got to be bloody Oppenheimer when it comes to getting the chemistry right.

EBX: Are you certain that you want to share your living space?

M: One hundred percent. Down to the last matchstick.

EBX: "The last matchstick," what's that supposed to mean?

M: OK OK, maybe it's not a phrase, but I want to share everything. Postage stamps, bicycle pumps, vinyl records, rain jackets, shampoo, toothp... \[pauses contemplatively\] It's not just food. Toilet scrubbing needs to be thought about too. I enjoy doing that, once you've scrubbed the toilet you've proved you're serious about chore-sharing.

EBX: Erm, good for you but please let's not high-five afterwards. What is it that you can offer to your housemates?

M: My philosophy is "be the psychologist you want to see in the world." Nonviolent communication is revolutionizing my relationships right now. I hold dinner time conversation as an art. Don't spread this, but I literally catch up on current events sometimes before dinner so we can pretend to be civilized. Plus you get all the peer tutoring you want in Math, and Computers you want.

EBX: What could seriously annoy you in sharing space?

M: I cannot live with anyone that will not take "come talk to me if you have even the slightest problem" as a serious offer. No behind-door gossiping. Hubris. Bro-ism. The sort of person that has extraneous rings on their keychain.

EBX: Let's be real about finances.

M: OK, Rent is theft. But I can pay it. Have you heard of a "Wikipedian in Residence" that's the kind of job title that's secure when you're in the breast of multinational. I can write monthly cheques to the tune of $800.

EBX: How should we get in touch.

M: Email isalix a.t. g.m.a.i.l.c.o.m
