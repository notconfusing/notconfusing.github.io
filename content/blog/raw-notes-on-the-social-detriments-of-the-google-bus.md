These are the unedited notes of a paper I fear may never come to light. Therefore I **publish** them only to **avoid loss**. **You may safely skip reading this.**

==Housing==

Want to make a housing community "faux-op".

Searching for housing difficulty.

3 bed ok, 4 very hard, 5 nearly impossible.

Went looking. - A lot of split houses, duplexes - flats.

===Rationale==

First thoughts are economic.

Any landlord realizes the profit in splitting the house.

Large properties into smaller sub-apartments. - Profit incentive.

==Social Effect, or perhaps Cause==

Second thought. More pernicious or at least a sinister side effect.

Like in Chomsky's manufacturing consent.

Powers that be want to keep us alone and seperated.

We might share expenses, share food, share tools. Realize different work opportunites. Realize new arguments (John Stuart Mills from Privacy VSI around page 111). We might talk more. Start a hackerspace. Organize politically.

This is undesirable for corporate profits, but more importantly it reduces 'sociability' or 'togetherness'.

 

I found freinds at Sudo Room through organizing and sharing. That's not a coincidence. It reversed a depressive trend. My life feels more fulfilling.

Bus==Transport==

Google buses is a term used collectively for private 'public' transport. Masquerading public transport.

Mirror the housing in the transport google bus scenario.

===My Commute===

\*Supportive job.

\*Distance subpart.

\*Non car owner, believe in public transit, and sustainability

\*I've made it work as best I can. Email, reading.

<div>

\*Car safety, WHO report.

</div>

<div>

Go

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

===Google Bus==

</div>

<div>

\*links to what they are

</div>

<div>

\*become intimate with their paterns by sitting in the East Bay parking lot.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

===Rationale===

</div>

<div>

The buses are too slow, infrequent, inconvenient.

</div>

<div>

Google makes a faster alternative.

</div>

<div>

Can't blame employees.

</div>

<div>

Except the company is diverting demand from public transport.

</div>

<div>

That shortens supply, and makes my commute harder.

</div>

<div>

Insiduous form of classism by providing better service to the elited. The Educated. Who are disproportionately not minorities because of our sexist, classicst, racist institutions.

</div>

<div>

Sometimes I imagine Googlers on the bus with me. Make imagery.

</div>

<div>

Still you can't blam the employees for taking the cheaper faster option.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

===Recourse===

</div>

<div>

So whats the recourse?

</div>

<div>

Well at first my idea was to petition to get Google buses to join forces with public buses to create a better system for all.

</div>

<div>

Yet they aren't interested, and here's the evidence.

</div>

<div>

(WSJ article).

</div>

<div>

Many corporations running competing routes. It would be financially beneficially for inter-company cooperation as well as inter-private-public cooperation. But they don't cooperate with each other, so defintely not larger. But why?

</div>

<div>

It's the same reason my best revenge is already had.

</div>

<div>

(Solnit).

</div>

<div>

Keeping the bedroom communiteis commuters alone.

</div>

<div>

Google homogenous. Note mingling with teh general public, or other private workers.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

(Saul williams) talk to strangers.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

My retort is Lena. A woman I met commuting on Public transport who had the same commute.

</div>

<div>

Impossible not to talk when you see her day in, day out.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

We became

</div>

<div>

-friends

</div>

<div>

-close friends through hours a day chatting

</div>

<div>

-iming at work.

</div>

<div>

-going to art murmur together; coffee at hers

</div>

<div>

-shared mixtapes.

</div>

<div>

-became confidantes - seen my travails

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

met others less close.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

Dig (Optional)  maybe that's why Google is struggling to make a popular social networking alternative.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

==Day After Update==

</div>

<div>

\*Bus was late

</div>

<div>

formed spontaneous carpool.

</div>

<div>

made congenial conversations. I answered a few questions that had always bothered me  about biology, from Gillead scientist.

</div>

<div>

Highlights ability to interact as humans.

</div>

<div>
