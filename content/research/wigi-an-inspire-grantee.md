WIGI, the Wikipedia Gender Index, my project which looks at the gender representation in Wikipedia Biography articles, [has won an Inspire Grant](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2015/05/01/meet-the-inspire-grantees/).

Over the last six months along with fellow Wikipedians we [prototyped](http://notconfusing.com/preliminary-results-from-wigi-the-wikipedia-gender-inequality-index/ "Preliminary Results From WIGI, The Wikipedia Gender Inequality Index") and [extended](http://notconfusing.com/which-index-is-wigi-most-closely-related-to/ "Which Index Is WIGI Most Closely Related To?") this research into a [paper Gender Gap Through Time and Space: A Journey Through Wikipedia Biographies and the 'WIGI' Index"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03086). One aspect of the biography gender gap we were not able to observe however was the trend of female and nonbinary biography.  We were only ever looking at a single point in time because it's too computationally complex to compare all the histories of the Wikipedias together at once. Now, [with $22,500 and a small team, our aim is to sample this data weekly](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/WIGI:_Wikipedia_Gender_Index) thereby gathering some longitudinal data on the way that Wikipedians are representing biographies.

Our project's form is to create a data portal which  will display the visualisations of the state of gender in biographies. The underlying data which associates biography gender with Wikipedia language, date of birth/death, citizenship, profession, and celebrity status, will be purposefully published under an open license. We hope that other researchers can make use of this social indicator, much the in same way one can United Nation's Gender Inequality Index.

The project is will be managed entirely [on github](https://github.com/notconfusing/WIGI), and should be completed in about 6 months.

It promises to be,
