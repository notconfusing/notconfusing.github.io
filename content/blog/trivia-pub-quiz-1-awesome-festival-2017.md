Prompted to find alternative ways to entertain my friends due to a herniated disc, I tried my hand at writing a trivia/pub quiz.

Please use, remix, and fix some of the impossible questions.

(The specific genre of audience-tailored trivia for a group of friends owes a deep gratitude to Sumedh Joshi R.I.P.)
