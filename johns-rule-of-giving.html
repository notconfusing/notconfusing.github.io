        <h1>John's Rule of Giving</h1>
<p>This week I received the saddening and shocking news that my friend John Romankiewicz was found dead. Today I want to honour him by recounting a lesson that he taught me about charity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>John's rule of giving:</strong> When asked for money on the street, don't just give $1. Give $5 or $10 or more. Give to try to make a real difference to who is asking you.    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>John and I met while working an after school childcare shift in San Francisco. It was part of <a href="https://standbayarea.com/what-is-solidarity-circle/">STANDS's Solidarity Circle</a>, a group of white men committing to volunteer for POC-lead organizations. 
Our schedules were cosmically aligned so we often commuted back to the east bay on BART together. One day we were discussing our positions in society, when John struck me with an uncomfortable challenge: give more. 
A tragically all-too-common occurrence in the Bay Area are people asking you for money in the street. Sometimes we become inured by those interactions, or maybe "avoid" it by giving just a small sum. But to really help he told me was more than that dollar or two, he challenged me to give $5 or more. 
Comically, during this discussion a man opened the door at the far end of the train carriage and walked through asking for donations. When he stopped in front of John and I, with no pomp John handed over a $20 bill and, and turned back to me to continued our discussion.</p>
<p>For the rest of our trip I asked about some finer details of his giving philosophy. To make giving larger donations realistic, he said he had pre-calculated a monthly budget for donations, sort of like a tithe. He admitted that 10% of income donations is steep, although said it was a good goal.
(As an exercise, I suggest everyone calculate how much they would be donating if they gave 10% of their income.)
I ultimately decided on a flat $100 per month. Since that day I am happy to say that I've set aside the amount and given it freely when the opportunity arises.</p>

<figcaption style="text-align: center;margin-bottom:5pt"><b>John taught me, make donations a line item in your budget that you can afford and give meaningfully.</b></figcaption></figure>

<p>John's rule of giving with its intent to give generously left an impression on me. Among other things, thank you for teaching me about charity.  I'll miss you friend.</p>
