In what could easily be a recurring annual trip,[Matt Senate](http://existenceproof.net/), and I came to Berlin this week to participate in [Open Knowledge Festival](http://2014.okfestival.org/). We spoke at the [csv,conf](http://csvconf.com/) a fringe event in its first year, ostensibly about the comma separated values, but more so about unusual data hacking. On behalf of [WikiProject Open Access - Signalling OA-ness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Open_Access/Signalling_OAness) team, we generalized our experience in data-munging with Wikimedia projects for the new user. We were asked to make the talk more story-oriented than technical; and since we were in Germany, we decided to use that famous narrative of [Häskell](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q92611#sitelinks-wikipedia) [and](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11829#sitelinks-wikipedia) [Grepl](http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q283302#sitelinks-wikipedia). In broad strokes we go through: *how Wikimedia projects work, history of Wiki Data-Hacking, from “Ignore All Rules” to calcification, Wikidata told as Hänsel and Gretel, signalling OA-ness, how you could do it too.*

These are the full slides (although slide show does not seem to like [our Open Office document](https://github.com/wpoa/OA-signalling/blob/master/csvconf/csvconf_data-hacking_with_wikimedia_projects.odp?raw=true) so much):

We missed half of lunch with the queue of questions extending past our sessions, which was fabulous to see such interest. There is a particular affinity we found with the [Content Mine](http://contentmine.org/) initiative, which wants to programmatically extract facts from papers. Since we are finding and uploading mine-able papers, you could imagine some sort of suggestion system which says to an editor "you cited \[fact x\] from this paper, do you also want to cite \[extracted facts\] in the Wikipedia article too?". Let's work to make that system a fact in itself.
