Since my foray into PhD I have been taking classes with projects to accomplish something. a UI, physical computing.

I've always wanted to do something "important" not a luxury product for the already privileged, or worse banal. but address volunteer doulas, or food insecurity.

i knew to avoid one problem which was that if the population is too vunerable then you will take from them but not give back meaningfully.

but in many cases you can over promise without thinking about it. my problem with the doula work. want to finish, but how can you finish without "supporting them forever" (whgi)

should we stick only to toys, or to populations that can afford this disruption. that feels like a poor solution.

perhaps special dispensation should be made on scope for more social projects. or maybe really, i ought to learn to scope better.

a difficult lesson to learn
