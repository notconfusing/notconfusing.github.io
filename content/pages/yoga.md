From age 17 I've suffered from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome due to my love of programming and addiction to Technology. Then at 23 I stumbled upon Yoga, and the relief it provided my hands and shoulders converted it from a hobby to a necessity in my life. Now I want to share the learning of how to live pain free for the hurting typist.

My journey to Yoga was complicated by the fact that I was also hopelessly stiff from irresponsibly weightlifting and bicycling. Well at least I thought the situation was hopeless. In fact through the magic of patience and humility Yoga showed me that nothing was out of reach as long as I took a long enough view - long like a lifetime.

My yoga practice today mixes traditional [ā]{.Unicode}sana with strongman exercises and mathematical analogies. My classes focus on all stiff people just dipping toes into become more flexible, particularly those with computer-aches and male-bodies.
