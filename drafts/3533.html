        <h2>Intro</h2>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQfFuMIQKY0"><em>Ceephax Acid Crew</em> Live youtube video</a> there's a comment which says "Love that one guy going nuts." And it's true, there is a guy in the front of the crowd feeling the music and letting his body follow. That's not a particularly amazing fact to many people, but to me its a revelation on a virality with which I'm infected. Because just 24 hours earlier, I was that person in the front.<br>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQfFuMIQKY0" style="width:560px !important" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>24 hours even before I was going nuts, I was getting nervous. Ceephax was playing at the Science Museum in San Francisco, and this would be my first opportunity to see him in the flesh. In that way that turns off your sense of decorum, I wanted to show him just what his music meant to me. My plan was to utilize some Nardwuar-esque deep fan knowlege. What only an unashamed geek would know is that Ceephax is, in addition to his music, a connoisseur of funky-design jumpers and carpets. He used to keep an gallery (that is sadly not online anymore) of the zig-zag neons, sharp-angled bright purples, and multi-coloured galaxy-exploding textiles that pepper our world. The morning before the concert I took time off work to go to the local charity shop to find an outrageous torso-warmer to give as a present.</p>
<p>Armed with the most outlandish garment I could scour, I shot to the museum, striding quickly and with purpose. I went alone and being by myself added an anxiety to the mission, I had no social cover, I had to admit my compulsion. I felt the omen in the air and walked my path of mystic discovery. The first rung in the gauntlet was that I had to find Ceephax among the exhibition halls. I asked myself, if I were Ceephax where would I be? Years of surfing forums had prepared me, and quickly found him by the audio hacking station. Here things got harder. Having spotted him from behind, I waited a moment, trying to calculate my next move. Tap on the shoulder? Insert myself into the conversation? What would I say? How much small talk?</p>
<p>Even though I'm not a shy person, I decided to wait near-by without giving any signals that I wanted chat, uncharacteristically my reverence was guiding me to be polite. That was gravity of the situation. But patience paid off, he got a bit bored and look around - then I pounced, "Hi Andy, I'm Max Klein [hand out for shake]." "Hi" he replied accepting my hand. The next seconds pressed on me as I found my words. "I like your music, and I know you like strange jumpers a lot, so I have a present for you." I handed over the jumper which he tried on immediately. It fit, and he thanked me. Then I slipped away unceremoniously. Later, in trying not to care waiting for the show phase, I saw someone else give him a jumper and he didn't try it on - I took this as the compliment I wanted.</p>
<p>Ceephax was the only act that night. This wasn't a music hall, there was no stage,  and the open space was proportioned poorly for a concert. As he played, I danced. The crowd was nerd-full, and they spread themselves out to stand back and nod their heads. I felt like they were insulting Ceephax, and his 4x4 beats which are meant for moving, and not caring how you do it. I went front and center, closed my eyes, and started to loosen my hips, my neck, and arms.</p>
<p>I turned to face the crowd rather than Ceephax, it was too much to look at him while he played, I wanted to show my appreciation and that meant no cognition, just embodied pumping, swinging and channelling of the drum machines. After a track of being alone in a semi-circle radius around the stage, one more super fan joined. I acknowledged them with a micro-nod worked into the frenzied dance, and went back to closing my eyes. On the second track, two more joined us, and on the third track another four, etc. until the crowd shifted and anonymized. The sweat came more easily and the acid house came alive.</p>
<p>When you get into an Acid house state, it's about going to your body's limits. The music get faster and harder until you think it can't get any faster or harder. When Ceephax pushes beyond that point, the music goes surpasses mental comprehension, it breaks a sort of barrier, and that's the key freeing moment. At that moment, you can't step to the beat, you have to accept the rules are broken. If you're uncomfortable without the tropes of dancing this will be frustrating. If you understand the game, you revel in the lawlessness of this temporary zone where the only context is pure chaos and it doesn't matter at all what your limbs do next, so you may as well try and do something very odd with them.</p>
<p>That night I reached acid-house-nirvana several times. I  binged on Ceephax, and my body was flushed of the pent up tension of not acting acceptably in polite society. I'd flushed, and was ready to restore normality. Which was why at the end, when the DJ in the admiral hat told me that he was playing an unannounced underground rave the next night in my stomping grounds of Oakland, I felt like I couldn't step through that next portal even though it beckoned so loudly. I knew I had to go, even though I had completely expended myself as if it all ended tonight.</p>
<p>So the next night, I found myself bicycling to "Babeland" in Chinatown in Oakland, an unsuspecting apartment-cum-venue for a night, in an unassuming part of Oakland. This was exactly the sort of place I wanted to see Ceephax, as grungy and unpretentious as possible. Upstairs there was an art installation with a playable NES whose visuals were distorted by filters, and the bar was serving rainbow-flavoured ice-cream for $1 per scoop. Underneath was the "stage" which was folding table in garage located at the end of a squeeze-through hall way. Fire standards would mandate no more than 20 people in the room. Maximum bus-in-the-rain capacity was probably 50 people shoulder-to-shoulder. There were probably 60 humans, and the 8 foot ceiling made is seem like even more. I worked my way to the front to get in position for superfandom.</p>
<p>Any beginning Ceephaxer knows that that he doesn't use computers to generate sound, only dedicated music equipment like synthesizers. I turned to the person in painted-on white jeans and tie-dye, "sometimes I like to listen to just drum machine and synths," I tried to impress. "Sometimes I like to just listen to drum machine" he retorted. It was a clever one-up, and I knew I was in the right place. What transpired that night was a sacred ritual which indoctrinated me into a cult of which I didn’t even know I was circling.</p>
<p>Here I didn't need to prove to the crowd that they should get close and dance their brains stupid. We were also so close that we were one megafan. Somebody who I recognized from the night before, put his arm around me as if to say "Welcome. You didn't know you were one of us did you? It's OK, its hard to admit at first, but you're among friends now". Then Ceephax went HAM. The experience encompassed me completely, the physical arrangement, the feeling of familial safety, the absolutely defeaning music.  The more we gyrated and spasmed, the more life outside went from inconsequential to not existing at all.</p>
<p>The wave started to swell. The cadence quickened and the tracks became more layered and punchy. We coming up to the acid edge. But just about when the hyperdrive was about to engage an unexpected twist came. Ceephax fumbled a button, and the machines started pumping at once, it was mayhem, and fate beyond any of our freewill.  You could see Ceephax exasperated, not being able to turn them off. It didn't sound "good", unsync'd beats were colliding akwardly. But at the same time it was amazing. We were already too high on snare-rushes and melodies that we went from "A to B to X".</p>
<p>It was all over when there were no more encores left to give. There was so much camaraderie was palpable.  We were tied together by ringing in ears and shirts that we were struggling to get off because they were soaked through. Our physical condition left us in no state to even communicate, we could only must "good" and "very good" when we saw each other smiling as wide as we could. In the end I just left as I couldn't take an my stimulation at all whatsover. On the ride home my brain start reverted to normalcy, I began to wonder about this hyperstimulation, and what my susceptibility meant to it. I wondered if I had undiagnosed epilepsy, and called my Mum the next day to see she had ever thought I shown signs of autism.</p>
<p>I still listen to Ceephax a lot, but beyond these concerts I can recount only 2 memorable instances of listening to Ceephax. Once at rave in the woods in Germany, where a few people got into it, and some men who were very serious about their house told me to turned it off. The other was at Burning Man when even my lax campmates actually preferred to go to be than take it any longer.</p>
<p>Ceephax Acid Crew is #2 on my list of music and associated transcendental experiences. Why? is the first by an order of magnitude.</p>
<h2>Early History and Sharing WHY</h2>
<p>sharing it with matt bradel in santa rosa on his lawn./</p>
<p>When I tried to play to Jess as we went to Subrosa. I was in the passenger seat. I think she only half got it.</p>
<p>the memory of how DC recommending to me in Brixton I've never attempted to contact WHY and Yoni? Is this a subconcsiouc attempt.</p>
<p>adi and the train to santa fe "lyricism is undeniable"</p>
<p>3. Earliest WHY? Memories.  berkeley and maybe seeing him around. madison margoline was into him.</p>
<p>train from porto to madrid - all night - also playing worms</p>
<p>watching sod the seed after critical mass. see the irony.</p>
<h2>Obsession</h2>
<p>when i first moved to oakland walked along fairmount street to try and find the washing machines. "the long walks home from the laundrymat" seemed important. (this is when it was more of a solitary  thing.) also there is a fairmount in SF so may not have been the right one.</p>
<p>but it hasn't been the only piece of art i've tried to mimick, as with a small obsession with trailerparkboys i ate salami (but never got the hockey stick).</p>
<p>Actually I can't pinpoint this next listen but it was since I have come to enjoy my relationship wichi is looking to be long term. But whe why laments that hes 'you were so heavy in my heart boo/ that no longer could my true heart hold you..." "but i'm hard to be around and sterile as a rouse mule". Well it didin't fit anymore. Why is not fair weather music. Its the opposite. It's stormy. No that's not true its stormy at times. But is just otherwise a magnification of unremarkable times of the terror of the neutrality of life (that construction is like 'concerned with the burden of scrutiny' in dooulbe "ofs") "the longs walk home from the laundrymat".</p>
<p>only person ive made annotations for rap genius before. (really long foot note about how i interviewed at genius, and then was not quite seeing eye-to-eye and then asked for $500 which they refused).</p>
<p>chatting with OKcupid librarian, who told me about hymie's basement, and i that elephant eyelash is an erection.  And the lyric from Hymie's basement is "people [check/fix] their hair before they walk into a room".</p>
<p>and i did buy the mozipedia one day. which amazon told me i placed the order of on May 26, 2011</p>
<p>6. It's an obsession? pg. 71 "for though I think about updike a lot I seldome read him. Sure a true obsessive would read all the available works." For me its kind of like my finding of radical honesty, (even though only other people would call it that since they read about it first and then acted it, and I acted it and then later found that it was a movement) was perfectly embodied by the music of WHY? and so that's why it's not an obessison, because I don't need to listen to everything of there's. It's about the concept of them.</p>
<p>8. When I saw Y in concert at the New Parish I did hang around hte courtyard nonchalantly hoping I might meet him in some desired to hangout in Oakland again He has an album Oaklandazulaasylum which I habvent listend to much or ever really at all.</p>
<p>Oh I long to just be able to list to it now, intently start to finish on this Sunday (oaklandazlulasylim) I've already excitedly clicked on tvergecast ep 164 hoping for an hour of distraction - but I'd already listened to it. I NEED an hour of audio distraction.</p>
<h2>Memory Criticism</h2>
<p>difficult to not listen to the podcasts since there are 70 episodes all topping an hour, which would probably be about equivalent to how much ive listened so far to the albums.</p>
<p>6. I just don't have the early childhood memories to give as much historical mostivation for this project - if I were to follow the script exactly. "i expose my lungs to the whole crew, you sneak a bump and smoke cloves in the cloak room". in my youth i wanted the danger of the latter desperately, but somehow found the greater release of full confessionism. i still remember the first time i smelled a clove walking home from hight school on a hot day.</p>
<p>1."He has to know how I feel about him"</p>
<p>2. How would he react to his reading of this?</p>
<p>3. WRT no rereating, or in this case no relistening. I have broken that a lot, but what have I gained from have a rule and then breaking it.</p>
<p>3. How much of each work I've listened to<br>
part time cage - one half-listen in israel.</p>
<p>oaklandazulasylum</p>
<p>elephant eyelash</p>
<p>alopecia</p>
<p>eskimo snow</p>
<p>mumps clouddead</p>
<p>Why memory criticism serves:<br>
- "a multiplicity of examples would compete to illustrate a single point in place of the one example that had made the point seem worth making in the first place".</p>
<p>shouting top of my lungs riding in no-riding construction zone in minneapolis. [broken no listening pact]</p>
<p>I can actually read a lot of baker [baker]</p>
<p>8. Shoud I not have re-read U&amp;I as well? The project wouldhave been if not impossible the low fidelity to its aim.</p>
<p>5. "im a regular person, so you have to believe me when i say that updike is a genius.</p>
<p>6. Have I written musical criticism before? That Jay-Z retirement disappointment from sex drugs and cocoa-puffs. Do I want to be known for music writin or for having lauded WHY so openly. (a good foot note about what that Jay-z essay was supposed to be).</p>
<p>6. thinks his tecnnique might be known as "memory criticism" or "phrase filtration" or "closed book examination"</p>
<p>6. Iomlication that memory criticism require "ten yes" will 7 do? (if alopecia is 2008) could be two days short of 9 years if Jan 1st 2008 - Dec 31 15)</p>
<p>6. The memory criticism assumes that not relistening is filtering out the very strongest part, but is it really? or were they just at a time in my life when my memory receptors are wettest and most receptive. (The wet/dry mix analogy from music production really speaks to me. So yest are my memories of why? not just when i was most predisposed to remember. Like my wet sticky brain after sleeping with genevere? wet lik a squish sticky toy that you throw on the floor just to see it spread.</p>
<p>6. Baker has 3x5 cards of phrases but to me hte lyrics stand out bit but they are the listenings that stand out the most. It would be as if Bakers readings and not his read words were more important.</p>
<p>How does the final tally of AVAILABILITY of peronsal information come out since A) updike was more famous than Y but B) the modern digital age means more miniutiae makes it to the fan.</p>
<p>Definietly goes in<br>
It really bothers me that the levels of intra sentence discussion don't have explicit punctaion support but have to inferred. Id prefe a LISP-SCHEME type scheme-system fwhere you know exactly the relation beteween subclaueses and subsubclauses. With just then comma you basically have only the flattened list of what is really a tree structure. This is especially trun in Bakers long sentences which actualy do hav parentheses, but not nested or enforced , and do have footnotes but don't interreatlate to the other delimiters.</p>
<h2>WHY the Person</h2>
<p>that story, when they were on the spanish farm I could relate to.</p>
<p>in rome listening to podcast where he disvalues the pitchfork review for being 'acerbic'. Too close to the reviewers real experience and freaked him out - is Why?'s guess.<br>
It's sort of like he "broke" pitchfork. Like the 2.6 is really a 12.6, an off the charts wrap around.</p>
<p>2. My own lyrical attempts or talk thereof</p>
<p>7. we are both White Ashkenazi Jeweish hetero. "but so what that class includes millions". What does our whiteness mean for rap? Acknowledge: yes this is men writing about men. What do I know about his parents, Not except they are kind of Jew that my parent's wouldn't recongnize.</p>
<p>And I do like Morrissey. In fact morrissey is even top more. But Morrissey, despite that he tries to shun his fame, is still famous. I couldn't fantasize about seeing him on the street like Yoni.<br>
Yoni does a cover of Morrisey that I found on Youtube.</p>
<p>Is it Yoni, or all of WHy? 7. I don't really care about his brothe. But I did upload his sister's CD to what.cd. SORRY.<br>
I've only been to one concert, is that enough?What do I remember from that conrcet. The encore, but really the encore power. The pereforamance was outrageously polsihed and emoitional the fans were rabid (rabid is too cliche).  after a long concert the compleltey packed house (thighter than sdtandard american space-bubbles would normally dicate) just apluadeded and whooped and shouted in a wide constant stream that even after 5 minuets didn't diminish in any volume. The crowd had 20 minutes of encore cheering in them. So they played one more song and it only stoked the fans further So after they de-staged 5 more full force jet thrust cheers erupted and then Yoni came on stage solo. And he sang unaccompanied "as adeck of card". and what I really remember was the way he snapped as his own percussion track because it seemed a bit awkward. Like it was a feat that he could only manage because he pracide it 200 times, not because he is so rhythmically gifted that he could just snap along to his own rapping. but I liked that it was successful even though it was hard for him becaus that all part of his acessibilibly, that htis is just a guy who has tapped into his feelings and he's just practiced being musical enough to support demostrating that fact to fans. You can see the same thing is his Youtube piano of Morissey "Half a person" "I checked myself into hte YWCA." HE's play by memory</p>
<p>NOW can launch into morrisessy comparsison.</p>
<p>is morrissey more qoutable? the other night i told a roommate, "i wanted a job, and then i got a job, and heavens knows Im miserable now." so he may be quippier. and why is overall less "sad" or mopey, but rather blank presentation of absurd facts of life.</p>
<p>What would it be like the hangout or golf with Yoni. In his case it would probably be more like going to yoga with him. Would I want to influence him though? expand a scene where im teaching him yoga or we are yogaing together<br>
interview he gave on skype with a fan.</p>
<p>6. Shorting circuits, Updike calls it "acerb" and it Baker's father's vocab word, and WHY?'s reaction to the 2.4 pitchfork gave him. (Before I said 2.6, i can't besure of the exact number, but the tenth of a point was even).</p>
<h2>Appeal and Faults</h2>
<p>Am I too concerned with the Burden of Scrutiny?<br>
I conquered my own childhood silence and now the world is my lit confessional marquee.</p>
<p>pg51 on confession and necessity. WHY has similar notions to updike about being very honest "I think taste is a social concept and not an artistic one. I'm willing to show good taste, if I can, in somebody else's living room, but our reading life is too short for a writer to be in any way polite. Since his words enter into another's brain in silence and intimacy, he should be as honest and explicit as we are with ourselves."</p>
<p>crying near a bridge in basel</p>
<p>walking from bus stop to oclc, headphones the guilt racked liar pretends to confess.</p>
<p>Maya said: "for how much of a portion of people's lives are spent worrying about being out of rhythm or not knowing what they are doing with themselves or self pitying its underexplored in music" and why is all self exploration. Sell the teapot on craigslist but broken handle.</p>
<p>7. How does he rank on "intelligence" Its an outstanding quality. Its this pconeers confessions that are the triumph.</p>
<h2>Faults</h2>
<p>Its also clear by his "flow tone" or "rap inflection" that he really only has one that is his comfortable natural default, even if he does expermint with other sometimes. Like on "rapping 4 moneyy" the way he "drops" economic crisis. You wont hear that on a WHY? album . He's doing it because he has to fit in, more with the rappers or their impressions.</p>
<p>but anyway if your life goes well its not reinforcing that feeling.<br>
[Intsert laundry as another repeated metaphor]. (long walks home), (putting two coints into a washing machine")</p>
<p>7. Criticism of WHY? Repeating imagery "customary clothers of my time" "we wore as was the style" and at the beginning of elephant eyelashes.</p>
<p>7. mistakes disappear into the general pension fund of admiration.</p>
<p>Actually I can't pinpoint this next listen but it was since I have come to enjoy my relationship wichi is looking to be long term. But whe why laments that hes 'you were so heavy in my heart boo/ that no longer could my true heart hold you..." "but i'm hard to be around and sterile as a rouse mule". Well it didin't fit anymore. Why is not fair weather music. Its the opposite. It's stormy. No that's not true its stormy at times. But is just otherwise a magnification of unremarkable times of the terror of the neutrality of life (that construction is like 'concerned with the burden of scrutiny' in dooulbe "ofs") "the longs walk home from the laundrymat".</p>
<p>but anyway if your life goes well its not reinforcing that feeling.<br>
[Intsert laundry as another repeated metaphor]. (long walks home), (putting two coints into a washing machine")</p>
<p>==Cheating==</p>
<p>i tried hard not to cheat, and not listen to WHY. But in some ways it made the feeling ever more potent.<br>
"I'm not a ladies man, I'm a weighing mind, filming my own fake death."<br>
I had embarked on the adventure of moving to Minnesota. I was forced to bike, but to bike in the cold there was only one way to do it which is to bike exerting maximum energy. to get into a frenzy that will not only warm you, but give you the psychological boost to endure. but a frenzy is not an easy state of mind to get into. i'd find different tricks. mostly music at high volumes. but you build a tolerance. eventually it's still the middle of winter and there's no gas left in the tank, and on top of that the fuel richener's can't make the fumes any more potent. I had to do something forbidden, dangerous, like the time i masturbated in the gardens of versaille during a blizzard. in this case it was listening to alopecia from the beginning. i've been filled with energy before when riding a bicycle, for instance burning man, for instance the week after burning man in the california sun with mental untethering and unglueing, and no hands on the handlebars as and the association-released seratonin dripping through the neurology, like an iv-drip, which each drip aggitated the by the 4x4 undending bass. and i'd start to feel my breathing, start to draw in deep, deeper, deep as a i can while pedalling at full speed. the most fundamental feelings of existence amped up to maximum volume, drawing in the biggest breathes that i can as rough and strong as i can, contacting my hamstrings and quadraceps the strongest muscles in my body. that's being alive.</p>
<p>And that's what WHY gave to me on the occassion of another blizzard in which buses were horribly delayed and lyfts were 3x primetime, and its only 3 miles away, and what' am i so afraid of. when you ride a bike everyday you get a rythm and order. load up the paniers, put on your sweatshirts, you waterproof shell, then shoes, then gloves not on but with the attachement string around the wrist, then helmet, then goggles, then play the music, then earbuds, then gloves proper, and then ride into the snowstorm.</p>
<p>i later found out that the "snare" sound at the beginning of "the vowels" is a chain being whipped against a concrete floor. and you don't have to know that in order to get hte jolt of industrial maschine engine cranking .</p>
<h2>And the difficulties of writing about it.</h2>
<p>I haven't given up. Yes I have listened to why many more times now, despite my vow. Including on 2 road trips.</p>
<p>The first was with Adi when we went to Arcata. Whenever i drive north, i try to drive very slowly to maintain the chill. once morten and i drove at a maximum of 45 mph all the way to portaland just to ensure our relaxedness when we got there. and we had 2 craigslist rideshare people in the car with us who we forewarned were part of the experiment. its a most apocryphal story.</p>
<p>adi and i were releaxing. i had listened to moh llhean just when it first came out and enjoyed it, but it took some low moment when my back was properly fucked and so was my life and i plodded sullenly through the city to understand it. the particular song was one mississppi. we poored over about what it meant to know to submit to whatever it was in control. and how the escape route is to focus on the breath, to take ten deep breaths, and when that's even to difficult you have to summon all your energy and take just one breath. it's a song about.</p>
<p>i hated nick cave for being old in copenhagen trying to get into it. he was sixty trying to be 20. why not sixty trying to be sixty. only had the haunting schtick. and same for morrissey. on schtick pony. morrissey was ruined for me seeing him trying to huff it one more time in mexico city to the easy crowd (is it real or not that mexico are morrissey fanatics i have a sound clip of julieta saying just that). so is my obsession with why? bound for this same fate. a sort of gorging until your sick. a kind of gorging that takes 10 20 years to eat all the sugar until you vomit. i'm not sure the fate is any different.</p>
<p>and it could be, because i did find the liimit to my fandom. rob and i were driving, agian to portland. rob had been recently divorced, i was trying to lift his spirits. at least to the cheerful level of when we would listen to eskimo snow while washing dishes and cleaning the kitchen in our ever messy cooperative. we were friends, and then something more than that when i discovered rob was a why die-hard. except there was a slight difefrence, his fandom was based or anchored around the love for eskimo snow, his introduction and his 10-out-10 album. for me, that was alopecia. and i learned they were recorded very close to one eachother so they are in some ways cutfrom the same cloth anyway. a few days before the trip in my desired to expand my podcast reach i was browsing some feeds, perhaps by topic, certainly not popularity. and quite coincidently i found "when the sun sets east" by ark e, a podcast dedicated to unpacking every why album and every song. i had just listened to 2 seasons of dissect, which pulled apart kendrick lamars 2 pimp a butterfly, and lauryn hills "miseducation". [i went down the rabbit hole of to pimp of my own accord. i listend to miseducation because adi had chosen it as a classic album that i needed to understand in oredr to understand her, as a swap activity we did one night in 2018]. (i wnated to conscioulsly get to know adi better, we were getting married and i remember in baker's room temperature (or whatever the 2nd book is called about his child, taht he talks about patty saying "dime on my butt" after she wakes up one morning with a coin pressed into her rump). dissect was well executed and was the deep-dive i craved for the music i too had listened to in tremendouse detail. it was a excellent because it was specific and niche, tailored for desired for specificity in that exact niche. i couldn't have been more ready to repeat the the delectable process and learn minute details about why albums. the episodes extended to 90 minutes all signis pointed to yes. but it wasn't to be, it was torture, the blanchard brothers, hosts of the "the sunsets east" delivered anguish in the place of geekdom. it  suffers primarily from banter-bloat, 20 minutes of unexplained inane brother injokes and unrequested family discussion, feckless promotion, and repition of all of the above bookend the episodes and discuss the podcast's topic almost not at all. when they do  get down to addressing why, they lack the power of description, primarily telling their audience if they like the tracks and which migth be their favourites, and only if we are lucky is it explained why. one the blanchard brothers (i do recal their first names) does occasionally excerpt a lyric that is poetic (now we're getting somewhere!) but will stop at remarking that is clever, or maybe nostalgic, or rocking. the other brother might call a transition "dope" and then offensively fake a jamaican patios completely unprovoked. they were ruining my subject. i have written as you can see tens of thousands of words unpacking why's impact on my life. how could they beat me to market, (not that they were taking much market share though, having bragged at one point of their 100 downloads) they are giving why-fan-literature a bad name, not that i'm sure why ive ever felt the need to save it, or reperesent it in the first place. it is because i think i can do it well. better even now. in fact givin up on te podcast in the car we went to listen to the real deal, and my naughty, prohibited full listen on alopecia again gave me this insight</p>
<p>homo-eroticism.</p>
<p>alopecia have subtle homoerotic references.</p>
<p>"sucking dick for drink tickets at my cousins bar mitzvah" "two men fuck in the dark corner of a basketball court, just the slight jingle of pocket change pulsing". if you grew up with white kids who only look at black and puerto rican porno cos they want something that their dad don't got (the large penis i presume). these hands (are we to belive hands) are my fathers hands but smaller.</p>
<p>now i believe this to be some small confessions of, fascination with a repressed gay thoughts that yoni has. and on this point i can relate. in kendricks madd city he asked " would you believe me if i told you young kendrick murdeded somebody" and later outlines  the same crime in the plot of the album. for some reason its hard to accept this confession, for one its borderline, but mostly because kendricks current stardom and cool magazine-cover demenor places him in my eye above a sort of meaningless gang murder. but its there in the text. why not take the confession at its face value. and here yoni wolf is doing the same, he is litterally talking about his own sucking dick, as much as he talks about eating pussy for new fans. why does the latter seem more plausible more literal and less allegorical. is it my interalized homophobia. do i not want my idol to be complexly gay, in the same why that i don't mysefl to complexly lay on the kinsey scale? this is the simplest explanation in fact that it was always my lens that cast shadows on these clear allusions. the only conflating factor is that yoni presents as straight in his non-musical podcast.  i recall he interviewed a porn-star that was a fan of his (or they went to highschool together) whose name began with april? and i will say with a hint of needless shame that i found her videos on xhamster later. ok so yoni is bi-curious, or was when he was 20, he was travelling europe. he was away from his external peer pressures, no one would see him, his hookups his gaze would not be judged and he watched some man-fucking. and anyone would do the same. i should know i calculated the data in a spreadhseet i kept called sex.ods where i found that in execess of 50% of my same-sex sex happened while i was travelling, where i didn't need to self-repress to perform straighness to my crew, or so my post-hoc theorizing goes.</p>
<p>final thought. lionel ritchies "all night long" contains the lyric, a short burst "fiesta" which i belive has an hommage to it on testarossa on "simone" but drunkely imitates that same "fiesta" stab.</p>
