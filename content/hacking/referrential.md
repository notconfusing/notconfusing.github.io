You might be perusing through the latest issue of [Refer Journal](http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=n2%3A0144-2384&qt=advanced&dblist=638) and come across my latest article *Wikipedia in the Library*. Andrew Gray of the British Library and I focus on the need and opportunity of bringing Library data in Wikipedia. Form the introduction,

> Wikipedia has traditionally been a divisive topic among librarians and academics. Its goal is undeniably positive and almost utopian – access to all of human knowledge, in every language, offered freely to the world. In practice, however, it can typify “the problem of the internet” - a morass of disorganised information, of dubious accuracy and reliability, offered up without ***authority or control***.

Adding identifiers such as Authority Control has been my main focus for the last year. It's not the most obvious backbone support for a Wikipedia article, but for those who want to move past just [satisficing](www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1777902) themselves it's key. When you get drawn into the debate around the reliability of Wikipedia you are tempted to choose a side in the warring factions. But of course the answer is to use both for what they're worth. To link both we need identifiers, as we write,

> The presence of the identifiers allows external services to link into Wikipedia, allows Wikipedia articles to reliably link out to library-hosted records, and helps curate and control the organisation of the articles themselves.
