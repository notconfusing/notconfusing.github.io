My favourite Hackerspace [Sudo Room](http://sudoroom.org/)  is very close to  [Bay Area Public School](http://www.thepublicschool.org/bay-area),  whose concept of a anti-capitalist University intrigues me very much. In chatting  about their plans for Math education, they expounded on the need for a primer to Set Theory, as they had been learning the Philosophy of [[[Alain Badiou]{style="color: #993300;"}](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q311005#sitelinks-wikipedia)]{style="color: #993300;"}, who utilizes those foundations. Their request was for softer, more intuitive introduction. And just a short 18 months after that casual chat, this last, Saturday June 14th 2014, I held that public education, and it went brilliantly. 2 very curious mind showed up and we had fun reading the comic example aloud. The comic we used as a launching point is [[[Logicomix: An Epic Search for Truth.]{style="color: #993300;"}](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2537008#sitelinks-wikipedia)]
