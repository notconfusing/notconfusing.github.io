This is a bedroom in a 9 person cooperative, for sublease between July 9th and August 13th (Flexible).

Location is 59th Street and Shattuck Avenue in Oakland, near Ashby BART.

The house is highly communal, but in an informal way - its more of a gift-economy feeling, than a lot of planning. I.e. there are not official chores, but the expectation is that you will do some cleaning when you have some time to be nice, although no one is keeping track.

The price is \$650 per month, and about 95% of our food is communal and costs about \$110 per month.
