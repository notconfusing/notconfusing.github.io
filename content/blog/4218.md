\- combat phone addiction, because i want my mind back  
- do i want a minimalist phone, a phone away from phone, better discipline?

-- how it works  
- data sim with google fi for free put it in your current smartphone  
- put your main sim in a dumbphone  
- choose the right phone for your situation

\- like the palm approach  
- phone number management: you can manage mostly with a datasim because texts can be sent over hangouts, and calls with hangouts-dialer.

--- is it good?  
- do i have more phones now?  
- i do believe its a lot to do with discipline, but also the odds are stacked against us in this time of being a variable in datamining operations.
