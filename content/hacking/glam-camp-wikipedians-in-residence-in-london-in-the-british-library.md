I am a Wikipedian in Residence which, unsurprisingly, I often have to explain to people what that actually means. Yet, the occupation is on the rise, and I wonder when the day will come when such an explanation is not necessary. I investigated the history of the number of people in this employ while musing at [GLAM Camp London](uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAMcamp_London/September_2012), and had this output.
