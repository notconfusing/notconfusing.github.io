<p>==Housing==</p>
<p>Want to make a housing community "faux-op".</p>
<p>Searching for housing difficulty.</p>
<p>3 bed ok, 4 very hard, 5 nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Went looking. - A lot of split houses, duplexes - flats.</p>
<p>===Rationale==</p>
<p>First thoughts are economic.</p>
<p>Any landlord realizes the profit in splitting the house.</p>
<p>Large properties into smaller sub-apartments. - Profit incentive.</p>
<p>==Social Effect, or perhaps Cause==</p>
<p>Second thought. More pernicious or at least a sinister side effect.</p>
<p>Like in Chomsky's manufacturing consent.</p>
<p>Powers that be want to keep us alone and seperated.</p>
<p>We might share expenses, share food, share tools. Realize different work opportunites. Realize new arguments (John Stuart Mills from Privacy VSI around page 111). We might talk more. Start a hackerspace. Organize politically.</p>
<p>This is undesirable for corporate profits, but more importantly it reduces 'sociability' or 'togetherness'.</p>
<p>I found freinds at Sudo Room through organizing and sharing. That's not a coincidence. It reversed a depressive trend. My life feels more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Bus==Transport==</p>
<p>Google buses is a term used collectively for private 'public' transport. Masquerading public transport.</p>
<p>Mirror the housing in the transport google bus scenario.</p>
<p>===My Commute===
_Supportive job.
_Distance subpart.
_Non car owner, believe in public transit, and sustainability
_I've made it work as best I can. Email, reading.</p>
<div>
_Car safety, WHO report.

</div>

<div>

Go

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

===Google Bus==

</div>

<div>
_links to what they are

</div>

<div>
_become intimate with their paterns by sitting in the East Bay parking lot.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

===Rationale===

</div>

<div>

The buses are too slow, infrequent, inconvenient.

</div>

<div>

Google makes a faster alternative.

</div>

<div>

Can't blame employees.

</div>

<div>

Except the company is diverting demand from public transport.

</div>

<div>

That shortens supply, and makes my commute harder.

</div>

<div>

Insiduous form of classism by providing better service to the elited. The Educated. Who are disproportionately not minorities because of our sexist, classicst, racist institutions.

</div>

<div>

Sometimes I imagine Googlers on the bus with me. Make imagery.

</div>

<div>

Still you can't blam the employees for taking the cheaper faster option.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

===Recourse===

</div>

<div>

So whats the recourse?

</div>

<div>

Well at first my idea was to petition to get Google buses to join forces with public buses to create a better system for all.

</div>

<div>

Yet they aren't interested, and here's the evidence.

</div>

<div>

(WSJ article).

</div>

<div>

Many corporations running competing routes. It would be financially beneficially for inter-company cooperation as well as inter-private-public cooperation. But they don't cooperate with each other, so defintely not larger. But why?

</div>

<div>

It's the same reason my best revenge is already had.

</div>

<div>

(Solnit).

</div>

<div>

Keeping the bedroom communiteis commuters alone.

</div>

<div>

Google homogenous. Note mingling with teh general public, or other private workers.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

(Saul williams) talk to strangers.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

My retort is Lena. A woman I met commuting on Public transport who had the same commute.

</div>

<div>

Impossible not to talk when you see her day in, day out.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

We became

</div>

<div>

-friends

</div>

<div>

-close friends through hours a day chatting

</div>

<div>

-iming at work.

</div>

<div>

-going to art murmur together; coffee at hers

</div>

<div>

-shared mixtapes.

</div>

<div>

-became confidantes - seen my travails

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

met others less close.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

Dig (Optional)  maybe that's why Google is struggling to make a popular social networking alternative.

</div>

<div>

</div>

<div>

==Day After Update==

</div>

<div>
_Bus was late

</div>

<div>

formed spontaneous carpool.

</div>

<div>

made congenial conversations. I answered a few questions that had always bothered me  about biology, from Gillead scientist.

</div>

<div>

Highlights ability to interact as humans.

</div>

<div>

</div>
