iSchool at Berkeley was a department I revered during my time there lurking in the backs of lecture rooms for special events and timidly knocking on Professor doors, which is why I was so honoured when they [invited me to guest-speak at the infamous Friday Seminar](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/newsandevents/events/ias/20120824). On August 24th 2012, in front of 20 attendees I talked about my latest passion, creating bidirectional links between Wikipedia and other online databases by *link reciprocation. * [Vivian Petras](http://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/institut/personen/petras) gave a suitable opening talk about Europeana language problems form a half-technical perspective, which made a suitable segue into my talk, "Data Archipelago."

Unknowing on how much to delve into details of still-[in-review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/VIAFbot) [VIAFbot](https://github.com/notconfusing/VIAFbot), I attempted to strike a middle ground by describing how VIAFbot would work, and subsequently what that could mean for the future of connecting what I call *Data Islands*. The method that I propose in this talk is the *link reciprocation* technique, whereby an algorithm follows links going into Wikipedia then reflects and reciprocates those links back out to the initiating site. This imitates a [bidirectional linking structure](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Topology.html), which the ultimate loser in a hot debate in the creation of the web circa 1990.  A stand-out, Wikipedia always kept [bidirectional linking in its internal structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:What_links_here), but could not by itself  implement this type of link between the exterior Data Islands.  Given VIAFbot's hacked-way of making these cross-site bidirectional links we could create new ways to determine not only our interests, but topics in the intersection of our interests of which we were previously unaware (slides 40-46). As an analogy, I aimed to show that there were practical ways to create informational seaplanes to island-hop what I am creating and terming the *Data Archipelago*.
