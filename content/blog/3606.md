The theory is: the social norms and demographic of the programmer will imbue biases into the software and shape what it does, and so who uses it.

A lot of the classical examples focus around gender, like the assumption of playing a character that's male.

But there are other examples of habit leaking into design. For instance, let's take a look at the predefined genre which are the main entry points to the "explore" feature in soundcloud.

Look at the android predefined reject call with sms messages.

-   Can't talk now. What's up?
-   I'll call you right back.
-   I'll call you later.
-   Can't talk now. Call me later?
-   

Now, I won't say this is an clear example of \#DudesGreetingDudes\[link\], but it does seem to me to be tinged with what you might write down casually without thinking to much about it as a standard 20-something programmer looking to quickly enter in some example text. Certainly the use of "what's up?" in the first primary is a slang that is specific to a demographic of people that others might not use. If you are a linguist, what impression of linguistic bias do these snippets display?
