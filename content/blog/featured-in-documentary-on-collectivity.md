In November 2012 I planned and hosted [Wikipedia Loves Libraries in Seattle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/SeattleWLL/2012). While we scoured the old media held within the magnificent Public Library, a team of documenters found our activity to be media-worthyÂ  itself. The following is my part in a short about online collectives. The high production value and acoustic noodling aggrandize my sentiments at 2:06 and 5:27.
