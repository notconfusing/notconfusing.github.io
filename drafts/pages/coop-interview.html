        <p>To our explain ourselves here's a fictional interview of us in the East Bay Express:</p>
<p>EBX: Firstly, Can you supply a picture for the publication?</p>
<p>D: Smile!</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://notconfusing.com/coop/danny.jpg" style="width:640px !important"> Danny</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://notconfusing.com/coop/max.jpg" style="width:480px !important"> Max</p>
<p>(Mechanical whirring of a Polaroid).</p>
<p>EBX: So, Danny and Max, you're not new to the East Bay co-op scene, but you're not settled. What gives?</p>
<p>Danny: It's a matter of circumstance really. It's been about 2 years since we moved back to the bay, so we're working our way into that perfect nest, having come from the periphery. We want to find a year or more of laughs with people who are likeminded like us, but we don't know yet.</p>
<p>Max: Community is crucial to human vitality, that's why it's so important to get it right. You don't want to sit in your living room alone, you also don't want sit next to an obsessive pillow-fluffer, and yet you still want to be offered tea when they're making. You've got to be bloody Oppenheimer when it comes to getting the chemistry right.</p>
<p>EBX: Are you certain that you want to share your living space?</p>
<p>M: One hundred percent. Down to the last matchstick.</p>
<p>D: "The last matchstick," what's that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>M: OK OK, maybe it's not a phrase, but I want to share everything. Postage stamps, bicycle pumps, vinyl records, jackets, shampoo, toothp...</p>
<p>D: Maybe that's a bit much - I'll buy my own anti-flouride thanks. Certainly our house needs only one olive oil bottle, and no duplicates in the fridge.</p>
<p>M: And it's not just food. Toilet scrubbing needs to be thought about too. I enjoy doing that, once you've scrubbed the toilet you've proved you're serious about chore-sharing.</p>
<p>D: Good for you. And I'll cook the dinner and sweep the floors, but please let's not high-five afterwards.</p>
<p>EBX: What is it that you can offer to your housemates?</p>
<p>D: Do you mean besides my Kombutcha? You know I'm the director for non-profit food cooperative - I'm the Google doc master. Let's account. Let's plan. Let's make a fritata. Let's build a stylized version of Flemish renaissance drawing room entirely from craigslist free and urban ore.</p>
<p>M: It's true. You should see the spreadsheet Danny made for finding a coop right now.</p>
<p>D: Ahh, thanks.</p>
<p>M: Also, my philosophy is "be the psychologist you want to see in the world." Nonviolent communication is revolutionizing my relationships right now. I hold dinner time conversation as an art, and I literally catch up on events sometimes before dinner so we can pretend to be civilized. Plus you get all the peer tutoring you want in Math, and Computers at any level.</p>
<p>EBX: What could seriously annoy you in sharing space?</p>
<p>M: I cannot live with anyone that will not take "come talk to me if you have even the slightest problem" as a serious offer. No behind-door gossiping.</p>
<p>D: Hubris. Bro-ism. The sort of person that has extraneous rings on their keychain.</p>
<p>EBX: Let's be real about finances.</p>
<p>D: Let's.</p>
<p>M: Rent is theft. But I can pay it. Have you heard of a "Wikipedian in Residence" that's the kind of job title that's secure when you're in the breast of multinational. I can write monthly cheques to the tune of $800.</p>
<p>D: Ditto. True, a sizeable portion disposable income disappears down the throats of local organizations I support; Sudo Room, East Bay Bicycle Coalition, the Public School, Earth Tribe Yoga, and month to month fundraisers. I'd just consider my own coop to be on the list.</p>
<p>M: Yes, it was actually you that taught me my financial prowess.</p>
<p>EBX: How should we get in touch.</p>
<p>M: Email isalix a.t. g.m.a.i.l.c.o.m</p>
<p>D: stationaery a.t. g.m.a.i.l.c.o.m</p>
