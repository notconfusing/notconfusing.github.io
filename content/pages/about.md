Hello, I am *Maximilian Klein*, data scientist, yogi, fuzzy logician, conversationalist, wikipedian, white- and male-privilege identified, poet, freegan, cyclist, anti-anthropocentrist, experimentalist and dilettante.

I work for [CivilServant](http://civilservant.io/) where I realize, in code, field experiments that are co-developed with online communities—for online communities. My goal is to promote diverse thinking online by connecting social science theories (normativity in design) with quantitative methods (machine learning, statistical analysis).

On this blog though I share my own opinions, observations, and research.

+ [Essays](/category/essays) are more serious philosophy and self-study
+ [Research](/category/research-notes) stores my analyses not bound for publication elsewhere
+ [Blog](/category/blog) is where I write about any old tedium
+ [Hacking](/category/hacking) contains some of my open source tutorials and project write-ups.

The name *notconfusing* name encapsulates my philosophy—that nothing is beyond our comprehension should we do our best to understand and explain to others.  
> The world might be complex but it's not confusing.
