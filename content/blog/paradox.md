<div>

Should you take someone else's advice to trust yourself?

</div>

[Proof]{style="text-decoration: underline;"}

Case 1:

Suppose yes. Then you should take someone's advice to trust yourself. So you should trust yourself. But if you trusted yourself you wouldn't take someone else's advice. Contradiction.

Case 2:

Suppose no. Then you should not take someone's advice to trust yourself. So you should not trust yourself. If should not trust yourself then you ought to take other people's advice. Contradiction.

 

Since both yes and no to this question lead to contradiction then the question presents a paradox. Q.E.D.
